            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> and mine eyes were a fountain of teares: Jn the Chriſtall nature wherof, while I looked for the cauſe of this evill, that memorable paſſage of defeated Pompey, did offer it ſelfe to my meditation. An approved Author telleth us, that Pompey being defeated in the Pharſalick battell, as he fled to Aegypt, hee took off tht way to viſit the Philoſopher Cratippus, whom curiouſly he queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all there were any divine <hi>Providence or Moderation</hi> of humane things or not. For his own part he could hardly be perſwaded, that God regarded thoſe ſublunary things, becauſe he had the worſe in the better cauſe. The Philoſopher anſwered, that there was a full period appointed to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, beyond which they could not paſſe. The anſwer and the queſtion now I paſſe, becauſe I ſhall haue occaſion in the Treatiſe further to explane them. But may it pleaſe your Highneſſe to obſerue thus much, that if fleſh and bloud, or meere philoſophy, be guide in this inquiſition, a good man may looſe himſelfe: for not onely doth the Athieſt, from the adverſity of the godly, and proſperity of the wicked; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily conclude,

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HILST with mournful eye I often viewed the deepe and long continued diſtreſſe of your deareſt ſiſter, and of her royall Lord, it gaue me occaſion to inquire into the equitie of their cauſe, which in all impartiall judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhal be found ſo juſt, that they and all that loue them may appeale to God for the pleading of it: but perceiving the ſucceſſe not to anſwer the cauſe, and that ſome for want of love and ſome for want of judgement, did judge the cauſe by the events; I went, with David, into the ſanctuary whence I diſcovered the cauſes of their calamitie (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the goodneſſe of the cauſe) namely the all-wiſe God to be the chiefe workman, who putteth every one into the refining pot that he appoints for his treaſurye, they and theirs, and in them eſpecially all the families of God to be the gold; <hi>Aegipt</hi> or <hi>Babilon</hi> to be the ſornace; the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekits</hi>

Secondly, it was <hi>Ioſuahs</hi> honor to deliver the craftie Gibionits (once become his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates) from the fiue Kings, whom he put to the ſword: what honor ſhall it be to you to vindicate from diſgrace, and wrong a <hi>paragon</hi> of Princes, <hi>a tryed Iewel</hi> aboue the patience of <hi>her ſex, an onely loving and a lovely Siſter,</hi> a Prince perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the wicked, and deprived of all for the maintenance of the truth; a Princely iſſue, as deare and neare to you, as Lot was to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and laſtlie, the people of God in an <hi>Aegiptian</hi> thraldome? <hi>Teares</hi> here are the beſt Orators.

<note place="margin">The equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Bohemian warre on the Kings part.</note> As for the equity of the vvar, it will appear to the view of every indifferent eye, in theſe two particulars; Firſt, on his part it was meerly Defenſiue; ſecondly, it vvas undertaken for the maintenance of Civill right, and true Religion. If vvar be not juſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken upon theſe grounds, I know not any vvar at all to be juſt.</p>
               <p>For the former of theſe two; that the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> is his Right, it is as cleere to every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall minded man, as the Sun-ſhine at noon day, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe grounds: Firſt, it was freely offered unto him, when he did not ſo much as think upon it.

His onely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, that foiſted-in clauſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the 4, to procure and confirm to his poſterity hereditary ſucceſſion. This is fully anſwered in the related anſwer. Doth it ſtand vvith reaſon that a King Electiue, ſhall of his own head infert a new clauſe, to the ſubverſion of the fundamentall Lavves of the State vvherein he is elected?

As for the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>election of <hi>Ferdinaend;</hi> novv Emperour (as the ſaid anſvver
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8878:18"/>ſufficiently proveth,) it was none at all. Firſt, he deprived himſelfe of all right or title to that Kingdom, by rejecting and contemning the right electiue, and ſtriving to poſſeſſe it by hereditary right, (as the adopted ſon of <hi>Matthias,</hi>) or by ſome other right of bloud. And that this came not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himſelfe, but was the plot of the whole Imperial facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is as cleer as the light, in the particular inſtruments of the pactions and conditions betwixt <hi>Phillip</hi> the 3, King of Spain, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Archduke of Auſtria, <hi>Mathew</hi> the Emperour, procuring and confirming the ſame. The ſumme of all which is this; that upon certain conditions amongſt themſelues agreed upon, the hereditarie right of Bohemia, and Hungary, ſhould paſſe from one to another upon the fayling of iſſues. Where obſerue that all right of election, and by conſequence all right indeed, is quitted by the Emperour; but becauſe <hi>great is the ſtrength of truth,</hi> when hereditary right would not hold water, they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the right of election. A bare pretence indeed, if it be duely examined. Firſt, it was done the King being aliue, and ſtill King, and therfore of no validity: for in every E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection two things are required; a <hi>vacant ſtate,</hi> and <hi>lawfull Electors,</hi> the former muſt precede the latter; both theſe, in this pretended election, was wanting: for the full right was by reſervation in <hi>Mathias,</hi> with a joynt inhibition, that <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> ſhould not meddle with the government, and that upon the challenge of intruſion; which notwithſtanding he laboured to infringe againſt law and promiſe, and by vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Armes endevoured to turn an electiue power into an hereditary right; yea, and that before he was actually poſſeſſed, which made his election voide if it had been lawfull; for elections being conditionall, the conditions broke, the election is no election. As for the Electors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their want of power, the place being full, as they wronged themſelues, ſo they wrong all thoſe that had any intereſt therein. If the ſame grounds be well ſifted, his title
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8878:18"/>to the Empire and Hungary, will proue but a broken title. This I was forced to cleer, as briefly as I could, that the right of King <hi>Frederick</hi> might be the clearer; which being laid in the ballance of equity with the former pretended right, ſhall ſhew it ſelfe of a juſt weight, which the other vvants.</p>
               <p>Firſt the place was orderly quitted of all lavvfull chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, he vvas called vvithout ſeeking or intruding. Thirdly, he had an orderly unanimous and plenarie election, all vvhich, as I haue ſhevved, vvere vvanting in the former. Neither did ever the ſaid king infringe any of their liberties. This being as you ſee his undoubted right, ſtood it eyther vvith equitie or pietie, not to maintaine it? Compare his right and maintenance of the ſame, vvith the examples quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of the Campani, &amp; the Romanes, and out of them you ſhall ſee, as from the <hi>minor</hi> to the <hi>maior,</hi> that his cauſe &amp; action is as juſt as may be. Firſt the Campani vvere a free people, to make choyſe at their pleaſure of their Head and Governor; ſo vvere the Bohemians, and ever, haue been ſince their firſt being. Witnes all the Hiſtories of Bohemia, Hungaria, Polonia; the Annalls of Cilecia, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp; monuments of the Bohemians.
<note place="margin">Aeneas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius in hiſt;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bohem.</note> To the vvhich I may add, for the better cleering of the point, that Embaſſye of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh of France to the Bohemians, after the death of <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> to vvhom he had contracted his daughter, vvherein he requeſted them, eyther to chuſe one of his ſons for their King, or ſuch a one, on vvhom he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtovv his daughter. Secondly, they vvere unjuſtly invaded by a mightie people the Samnites; ſo did the Bohemians ſuffer much from the hovvſe of Auſtria, and no litle by the preſent Emperour. Thirdly, they ſought aide from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, vvho would not, but on juſt ground, undertake the vvarre, and therefore they became their ſubiects, and ſo they vndertooke it; ſo the Bohemians made ſuit to the Prince <hi>Elector,</hi> in their feare of cruell dealing, that he vvould become their King, and take the maintenance of their iuſt cauſe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8878:19"/>which he did, and that lawfully; not undertaking any thing for them directly, or indirectly before he vvas their King. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe together,
<note place="margin">In Nevio licet quod in Gais non licet.</note> and except that we wil ſay, that it is lavvful in <hi>Nevius, which is not lawful in Gaius,</hi> or a heathen Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate may doe for their ſubiects, vvhat a Chriſtian King may not doe for his, I ſee not whye the one in him, is not as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or more lawful, then the other was in them. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, If his ſucceſſe of poſſeſſion had ſeconded his right of election, a great many of our Engliſh Imperialiſts &amp; other drowſy <hi>Sybarits,</hi> would never haue torne his title, nor exclaimed on his practiſe, as they now doe. To them for the preſent, I will ſay no more, but to iudge actions by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, &amp; right of titles by preſent poſſeſsion, is, in theſe evill &amp; dangerous dayes, rather to approve of tyrannous intruders (both in church &amp; commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth) then of the true owners.</p>
               <p>As for the latter point of the ground, namely truth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the defence whereof he undertooke, It is the trueth and none but it, againſt which the <hi>gates of hell, the dragon, beaſt and falſe Prophet, the croaking frogges and all the drunken Princes of the earth, with the cup of the whore</hi> (doe what they can) ſhall never be able to <hi>prevayle.</hi>

<note place="margin">The ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies war.</note> ſo likewiſe, from the want of this ground, is laid open to the view, the iniquitie of all the warres, vndertaken by the enemies of God againſt his people: as the warres of Gog and Magog, and of the heathen Emperours, made <hi>vpon Gods inheritance.</hi> What ground had the great red <hi>Dragon</hi> for making warre againſt the woman, and to ſtand before her to devour the man child when it was <hi>brought forth?</hi>

What juſt cauſe had <hi>Philip</hi> the 2 of Spaine, to undertake by force of Armes, againſt <hi>law and covenant,</hi> the eſtabliſhing of the bloudy Inquiſition in the Low countries? The beſt ground I can find was, <hi>Duke de Alva,</hi> his <hi>hart-burne</hi> againſt the <hi>people,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Granvils ſpleene</hi> againſt the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> What account in conſcience, could the Duke and <hi>Red-cap</hi> giue, to counſell the King to conquer England, whereto he had no right at all, and to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8878:20"/>ſuppreſſe religion in all other places? For the effecting of this <hi>Chiapin Vitelli, Duke de Alva</hi> his Chiefe Captaine, was ſent with ſome faigned meſſage to the Queene; but indeed his errand was to try the Papiſts: for immediatly after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of England, the Earles rebelled in the North. And for fuell for this fire, <hi>Duke de Alva</hi> had ready in Zealand 10 Regiments to be imbarkt for England, but God quenched our fire quickly, and found him enough to doe at home for all his forces. But becauſe this ſucceded not, the great Armado in 88, was ſet out to ſinke our nation; For both the matter of that warre, and the cruell manner of the execution intended, if the ground be well ſearched, I thinke it will be found no <hi>better</hi> then the ſucceſſe. As for that Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniolized Popiſh <hi>pamphleter,</hi> indevouring with tooth and nayle to make good that Spaniſh invaſion, from provocation given by her Majeſty to the Spaniard, he ſhevveth himſelf a Viper to the honor of his Countrie, concealing treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly both the iniquitie of the Spaniſh ground, and his tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in the manner of proceeding,

He propounds likewiſe before him and others, that monſtrous <hi>abortiue, Caeſar Borgia,</hi> as a pattern to be followed: but to follow this pattern, or to uſurp anothers right, is the very note and work of a tyrant; as the Chancellour of Rochel wel obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the advice formerly mentioned.</p>

<q>In one of their helliſh hymns, they tell us, that holy King <hi>Edward,</hi> and gracious Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were the curſes of the land, vvho indeed vvere great bleſſings: they ſhew vvhat fire vve haue deſerved, and vvhat fire in effect they had provided for us; praying heartily, that <hi>the hearts of the labourers therein may be strengthned.</hi> Another of their Hymnns is, all full of triumph, namely, <hi>how after the year of viſitation,</hi> and Ioy of Iubilie, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhould be built again,</q> and the ſecond glory thereof ſhould be greater then he firſt.

Let <hi>Vitellius</hi> play the ryot, <hi>Tiberius</hi> the drunkard; will the ſouldiers be ſober? Let <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> ſit down to the diſtaffe, will his ſouldiers care for armes? Let <hi>Nero</hi> play the Mad-man, or rather the monſter of men; will not his ſouldiers be as mad and monſtrons as he? Let <hi>Ieroboam</hi> be an Idolator, all his followers will be of that faſhion. Let <hi>Lewis</hi> 11, be an egregious diſſembler, &amp; his Courteours will be of that cut. Thirdly, as nothing corrupts more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſo nothing is of more force to correct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their good example. When <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11, of France ſcorned learning, all the Court &amp; Nobles thought it but foolery; but <hi>Francis</hi> the 1, both being learned himſelf, and affecting the learned, every ſtate fell to affect learning. As the Romane Emperours and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders were good or bad; ſo were the ſouldiers better, or worſe. As valour failed in King <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; he began to ſubmit to the Pope; ſo his ſubjects were content to put their necks under forreigne Government: but as <hi>Edward</hi> the third, roſe up to be the <hi>hammer of popish power,</hi> &amp; to challenge &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his right, both by <hi>Counſel and Armes,</hi> the land became a <hi>counſell of war, and an</hi> army of <hi>valorous counſellors.</hi> Fourthly, the ſucceſſe of the war doth often follow the vertue of the commander. To omit other examples, witnes the Kings of Iudah. While they were good, they pevayled againſt their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8878:23"/>enemies, as <hi>David, Ezekiah,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 16</note> but by the contrary againſt the bad Kings, the enemies; prevailed; inſtance <hi>Achas,</hi> bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lord for a bad one, <hi>this is that Achas;</hi>

I will produce but one inſtance, becauſe I muſt labour to abridge my ſelf,
<note place="margin">The Turkes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by our ſinnes.</note> having many things to goe through. <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> relateth how they of Rhodes wrote to <hi>Frederick</hi> the third, &amp; the Princes Electors, how the great <hi>Turke,</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by his Nobles from making war againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, eſpecially againſt the Germans; his anſwere was, as he feared no Chriſtians, ſo leaſt of all the Germans; and that for 4 reaſons. Firſt, their diſagreement amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, like the five fingers of a mans hand which ſeldome come together. Secondly, they are diſſolute in their lives, by whooring, drinking and all manner of riot, delighting more in great plumes of fethers, then martiall armes. Thirdly, they are diſorderly in their proceedings. Fourthly, they neglect all laws of government, not puniſhing the bad or rewarding the good. As the Turke putteth theſe imputations upon a natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once ſecond to none (as they gaue good proofe to <hi>Caeſar</hi>) ſo I wiſh, that they, &amp; all Europes armies, could quit themſelves of theſe, better then indeed they can: for howſoever the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8878:24"/>Turke with <hi>Lamia</hi> his eyes, ſeeth much abroad and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at home; yet our home bred evils, which he thus taxeth are more hurtful to us, then all his forces;

               <p>Oh then that vvee vvould make a holy Warre indeed; that is, <hi>to be holy in our ſelues;</hi> and then neither Gog nor Magog ſhould prevaile againſt us. To this end, the Lord biddeth us <hi>ſanctifie a war.</hi> By which phraſe hee vvills,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.4.</note> that all that vvill vvar for him ſhould be holy. As this ſerveth to direct us what manner of ſouldiers in a juſt warre are required; ſo it diſcovers the blaſphemy of that Matchiavillian principle of Atheiſm; wherein with open mouth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Machiavils</hi> blaſphemy.</note> he preferreth Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm in ſouldiers, to true Religion; becauſe Religion (ſaith he) makes men humble, <hi>puſillanimious,</hi> or <hi>weak-minded,</hi> and more apt to receiue injurie then to repell it. Before I come to the anſwer, let me ſay thus much of him once for all; if that Atheiſtly <hi>burn paper, and blinde bayard,</hi> had lived amongſt the Heathens, and had dealt with their <hi>feyned gods,</hi> as he hath dealt with the <hi>true God,</hi> they vvould haue made him an example to the world, and would haue burned his blaſphemous papers in the fire; but as they humored ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly his lewd Countrimen, ſo they flew over the Alpes; yea, and the Seas alſo, infecting France, and all the reſt of Chriſtendome: Inſomuch, as the Sybillin oracles were the refuge of the Painims for their direction; ſo moſt Princes, and their affaires now, are guided by Matchiavel. Are not men now of diviliſh pates, and deep reaches to the evill, and ſuch as are acquainted <hi>with the depth of Satans poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> the onely <hi>men of ſervice</hi> (as they call them?) Yea, ſay they be but very beetles and block-heads, yet if their brains vvill ſerue to <hi>hatch toades,</hi> they will ſerue the turn as well as can be; if he can ſwear horribly, and blaſpheme fearfully,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8878:25"/>vvith termes not to be named; if he can roare and quarrell, and out-face heaven and earth by his ſinnes, he is fitter to be a ſouldier (ſaith the Matchiavilliſt) then he that will ſay, <hi>ſurely, and truely,</hi> and ſo forth: becauſe ſuch a one is a meer Puritan, and ſo weak and faint-hearted, that the enemy doth not fear him.</p>
               <p>To come then to the anſwer of the point: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more impious then the <hi>Poſition;</hi> and nothing falſer then the reaſon. For the firſt, is there any thing more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, then to prefer Paganiſm to Piety? If this had been good, in vain had <hi>Iohn</hi> perſwaded the doubtfull Souldiers to take a holy courſe. Likewiſe the reaſon (that <hi>true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on maketh men cowards</hi>) it is againſt <hi>all reaſon,</hi> againſt the nature of true magnanimity, the power of Religion, and the experience of time. Standeth it with reaſon, that hee that hath the ſtrongeſt on his ſide, ſhould haue the leaſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage? True magnanimity makes a man couragious to undertake the good, and hate and abhor the evill as a baſe thing, unworthy of ſuch a ſpirit. Who but the religious doe ſo?
<note place="margin">The power of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Alſo the power of religion, doth tie a man that hath it to his God, aſſuring him if he looſe this life he ſhall haue a better. The ſouldier thus perſwaded in his conſcience, and bearing Arms for a good cauſe: as for the glory of God, the defence of Religion, the good of his Countrey, and credit of his Prince; will not <hi>loue his life unto death,</hi> in the doing of his ſervice. <hi>Caeſar</hi> tells us, that the ancient Gaules were a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and warlike people; wherof he giues this ground, that they reſolutely beleeved the <hi>immortality of the ſoule.</hi> Haue not all the true Worthies of the world bin religious ones?

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8878:26"/>intreat them this office, which they willingly, and heartily performed in the name of Chriſt. God, as hee is ready to hear, anſwered their deſires with lightning upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and plenty of rain upon themſelus, which they kept in their Targets and Head-peeces, and drunk.

As <hi>Ioſephus</hi> excedingly commends the ſtrictneſs of militarie Diſcipline, that he obſerved among the Romanes; ſo the beſt and greateſt ſouldiers, amongſt Chriſtians, haue heavily complained of the want of this amongſt us, and that not without cauſe: for this appeareth in the loſſe of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, and Territories, to the Turke; whoſe obſervancie of

                  <hi>Seidlitzius,</hi> a Noble and militarie man, being captiue to the Turke, did admire (as he writes) the diſcipline of the Turkiſh armie, the modeſtie of their carriage,
<note place="margin">Historia Peregrinat.</note> and the ſecuritie of the country people, by whom they did March. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, with deteſtation, he vehemently reprehendeth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, raven, and more then beaſtly looſneſs, of our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that will be called Chriſtians. Whence is our fall, and their rize and ſtanding; but from theſe contrary courſes? The Turkes ſtrictneſs of diſcipline hath got what he hath, and our looſneſs of living hath loſt what he hath got.

It is true that great Commanders, as Emperours and others, haue not onely exerciſed diſcipline ſtrictly, but cauſed books to be written; as a booke in Greeke and Latine of Diſcipline, ſet forth by the command of <hi>Iuſtinian.</hi> The Emperiall ſanction for diſcipline, in the Parliament of <hi>Spier,</hi> Anno 1570, But for want of executors of theſe good lawes, wee may cry out with, <hi>Horace:</hi>

               <p>He that orders others, muſt firſt order himſelfe. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of a looſe Commander will doe little good upon others. And therefore <hi>Adrian</hi> is much commended; not onely for his admirable valour, and exquiſite experience, but alſo for his ſtrictneſſe towards himſelfe. In the warres he fared hard, his lodging was anſwerable; he marcht many times on foot with his ſouldiers, he ſpared no paines, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went willingly all labours; inſomuch that <hi>Florus</hi> the drunken Poet <hi>would not haue his honour with his paines:</hi> His eie was alwaies over his ſouldiers, he deſired to know them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; he would viſit them in ſickneſſe; and hee removed all things from the Camp that might remoue Diſcipline. So <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great would deſire his Souldiers to undergoe no ſtricter rules, then he would himſelfe. Such were <hi>Severus Scipio, Phirrhus,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Would to God our Commanders would imitate thoſe,
<note place="margin">Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> and doe but as much for an <hi>eternall weight of glory,</hi> as they did for their Country, and a name upon earth. I haue not onely read, but mine eares haue heard to my griefe, the heavie and true complaints of Souldiers, injuried by their Captaines and higher Commanders; namely, in detayning of their pay, which is indeed next unto ſacriledge. It offers violence to the whole Army, indangers the cauſe, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good; it cuts the throat of diſcipline. And therefore great Ones, if they loue their liues, and the honour of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their Country, let them with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and others, take heed that this <hi>ſtrange fire</hi> be not in their Armies, for fear they cannot quench it when they would. This is one main cauſe, why our Souldiers now a daies come ſhort (for the moſt part) of the Romanes valour; that they are neither ſo regarded, rewarded, nor juſtly dealt with. For beſides the puniſhment, it was an indeleble Character of infamy to defraud a ſouldier of his due.

               <p>Now to giue a touch of the particular colours. Every Company had their owne particular colours, with ſome ſignificant ſigne in them, for diſtinction and inſtruction.

The <hi>Rabbins</hi> tell us that <hi>Reuben</hi> had <hi>a man, Iuda</hi> a <hi>Lion, Ephraeim</hi> an <hi>Oxe,</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> an <hi>Eagle,</hi> together with their diſtinct co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and empreſſes.

In every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there muſt be a chiefe Generall to command, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to obey. And firſt for the Generall, his perſonall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and officiall indowments, ſhould alwaies anſwer the greatneſſe of his place: Such God gaue to his people, as <hi>Moſes, Ioſua, Gideon, Sampſon, David;</hi> yea, when he gaue them <hi>Saul</hi> for a King, and a Leader, though it was in his wrath, yet he fitted him for the place with excellency of gifts: take view of this in the firſt of <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. chapter, comparing the firſt, ſixth and ninth verſes. In the firſt verſe, <hi>the Lord annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to be Captain over his inheritance,</hi> for then the people of God had warre with their enemies: In the ſixth verſe, <hi>the ſpirit of the Lord ſhould be upon him, and he ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to another man:</hi> In the ninth verſe ſee this accompliſhed, <hi>God gaue him another heart;</hi> not for all this, that he had one ſparke of ſaving grace, for he was a reprobate. But God by theſe, ſheweth what excellent common gifts hee affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for ſo great a calling, as magnanimity, depth of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Princely behaviour. And in this ſenſe, in the ſixth verſe, the Lord is ſaid <hi>to be with him.</hi> I preſſe this point the rather; becauſe as from the head, as from a fountain, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath life and action: ſo <hi>in the ſufficiency of a Leader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſists

Another caution I add which is the chiefe indeed, that the Auxiliarie forces be not ſuch as come meerly upon ſelfe reſpects, who many times like mowls ſo undermin the ground, that they cannot be got out againe; and ſo ſuch vermine proue worſe then the former adverſary. A blacke brood of ſuch you ſee hath over ſpread

               <p>Counſell is very ſignificantly enblemed by <hi>Lodovicus Sfortia,</hi> Duke of Millain, by <hi>Morus,</hi> or the <hi>Mulbery tree;</hi> which name the ſaid Duke took unto himſelfe as his ſurname, not for the blackneſſe of his viſage; but becauſe he would bear the world in hand, that in his actions he was like this tree; for as it doth not bud nor flouriſh, till it hath paſt over the injury of the Winter, and preſently after bringeth forth buds and fruits, and therfore called the <hi>wiſeſt of trees.</hi> By this he would make ſhew, giving this in his Armes, that it was naturally given to him, to diſpoſe of all his actions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely and deliberately by counſell.

               <p>OBSERVE in the third place, the obiect of warre, which is the ſubject of Councell, and reaſon will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force us to walk by councell. Muſt not the Generall know his own forces, and his enemies; both for nature, power, furniture, and number, as neer as he can? Should hee not know how to diſpoſe of his own, whether horſe or foot;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8878:49"/>to take the advantage of the ground, to diſadvantage his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie all that he can, and by all lawfull Stra agems, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his enemies at the loweſt rate that is poſſible? Beſides all theſe to be conſidered, there is a further end, namely, the averting of all evill, and the procuring of all good that can be thought on. Doth not goods, liberty, wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, lands, liues, countries, Crowns, Religion, and Gods glory, (which is worth all the reſt) lye at the ſtake? yea, and on ſuch a hazard often, that if the firſt be loſt, there is little or no hope of playing a ſecond game. All theſe cry for counſel; which, under God, is the onely wiſe diſpoſer of the aforeſaid meanes, and obtainer of the end. If for other things of leſſe moment, wee doe not caſt the dice (as we ſay) but with great care, watchfull forecaſt, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate counſell, we labour to effect them, what ſhould bee done in this, where the adventure is ſo great, the iſſue ſo doubtful, and the leaſt errour may caſt all away?</p>
               <p>As the ſpirituall warfare of a Chriſtian is the matter of greateſt moment under the heaven; ſo next unto it, in my judgement, is the bodily warre. If men of all ſorts that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the name of Chriſt, would but take this to their conſideration, it would make them in the firſt place, take up the controverſie that is betwixt them and God, that hee might be on their ſide; ſecondly, the weight of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and worth of the object, would make them look to the laying of every ſtone, for making ſure the building; laſtly, having got a ſtout reſolution, from advice wel groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the object wel thought upon, they would ſtand faſt, quit themſelues like men, and eſteem ſo high a prize worthy of their deareſt bloud, deſiring rather to die with honour, then to liue with diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I come to the utility,

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8878:50"/>
                  <q>comment upon it. It is not of ſo much waight to carry many forces into the field, as to haue the Commanders of forces, men of counſell; becauſe wiſe counſell, and wittie skill is of far greater moment, then ſtrength voide of counſell.</q> As war without counſell, is as a Citie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out walls; ſo counſell in war, is both wals and munition, it affoordeth both invaſiue and defenſiue Armes. <hi>Counſell</hi> (ſaith <hi>Caeſar</hi>) <hi>is the ſame to me against mine enemie,
<note place="margin">Fame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis quam ferro ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes.</note> that the Phiſitian is againſt ſickneſſe; which he haed rather overcome with fasting, then with phyſick; ſo had I rather overcome with famine, then with ſword.</hi> As this Counſell hath often more prevailed then the ſword; ſo is it grounded upon good reaſon. Firſt,
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>famine fighteth within,</hi> as <hi>Vegetius</hi> vvell obſerveth, <hi>and therefore it prevaileth oftner then the ſword.</hi> Secondly, if the Defendant haue to doe with a humane enemy, he may ſaue himſelfe by capitulation. Laſtly, the forces of the aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant are without hazard. If you look but on the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of counſell; yea, even then when forces haue fayled, the utility of it ſhall further appear. Was not Romes Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth advanced by the counſel of <hi>Q. Fabius? Cato</hi> in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>Catiline</hi> ſaid, <hi>that their Anceſtors made themſelues great, eſpecially by good Counſell.</hi> Was not the State of Hungaria, and Bohemia advanced and maintained, to the diſhonour and damage of their enemies; the one by the counſell and dexterity of that renounmed <hi>Hunniades;</hi> the other by the counſel and proweſſe of that admirable <hi>Siſca,</hi> againſt the two moſt potent adverſaries of the world? Amongſt all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind, there is none more remarkeable then that of the State of France, under the government of <hi>Charles</hi> the Wiſe, vvho comming to the Crown, found a ruinous State ful of confuſion and calamity: for all Guyan, part of Normandy and Picardie were poſſeſſed by the Engliſh, through the great overthrow of <hi>Phillip of Valois,</hi> vvith eleven Princes, and tvvelue hundred Knights and Gentlemen, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by King <hi>Edward</hi> himſelfe at the battell of <hi>Crecy,</hi> and by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8878:50"/>another given by Prince <hi>Edward</hi> at the battle of <hi>Poiteiurs,</hi> wherein King <hi>Iohn</hi> was taken, and his ſon <hi>Philip,</hi> with many Princes and great Lords ſent priſoners into England, beſides thoſe two ſore defeates, one on the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby the foundation of France was ſhaken, and nothing left but the ruines of a Kingdom. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques were all on fire by civill diſſentions. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all theſe, the aforeſaid <hi>Charles Leſage</hi> (ſo called for his gravitie and wiſdome) comming to the government, did with ſuch prudencie and counſell compoſe and order the affaires of that troubleſome ſtate, that he firſt quenched the civill diſcord, and after, in time, recovered a great part of that, which the two former Kings had loſt, and that not without wonder: for he was not ſo brave a warriour as his father King <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor his grand-father <hi>Philip.</hi> Againe he had to doe with as wiſe a Prince &amp; as great warriour, as happy &amp; valliant a Generall, as euer Europe had; yet for all theſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie made him wiſe, and he tooke a contrary courſe to the former, undertaking and managing Armes with great advice and counſell, without which he would not moue one foote; it had indeed an anſwerable ſucceſſe, beyond the expectation of his adverſary; who ſeeing and admiring his wiſe courſes, whereby he dulled the edge of the Engliſh forces, (looſing ground they could not well tell how) King <hi>Edward</hi> gaue this teſtimonie of him,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Froyſord lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 132.</note> that he never knew king that uſed armes ſo little, and yet made him ſo much adoe. For as by miſſives he effected much buſineſſe (ſo ſaid he) <hi>he makes me more a doe</hi> with his <hi>Pen,</hi> then his father, or grand father did <hi>with their forces and Armes.</hi> By this his Counſell he brought his Kingdom from being a field of war, a triumph of ſpoile, a map of miſerable povertie, to be peaceable, plentifull and rich. In theſe inſtances I could be larger then the treatiſe will ſuffer, but I will ſhut up all with one, not unknowen, namely, of the ſtate of Spaine. What I pray you is the roote of his over ſpreading in <hi>Europe</hi> and other parts? Is it his proweſſe &amp;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8878:51"/>valour? No, the few Spaniſh warriours of note upon record ſheweth the contrary. It is then their counſell and ſlight, (eſpecially ſince it hath been fed with a fountain <hi>running un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ground.</hi>) In this their craftie diſpoſing of themſelves, they are not unlike the Hedghogge running with the Hare. Let the race be through the hedge, the Hedghogge is too good for the <hi>Hare</hi> (for what ſide ſoever he be on, he is alwayes before.) But that the Spaniard ſhould not be proud of this, let <hi>Alva</hi> his <hi>Trophees</hi> ſtay his boaſting. If he had beene a man of as much counſell as crueltie; he might haue ſaved a ſea of bloud, his Maſter a maſſe of mony, and prevented Spaines greateſt loſſe, which I hope he ſhall never reedeeme. What is it but the wiſedome and counſell of a Prince, aſſiſted by his privy Councell, that commendeth himſelfe, &amp; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth others? It is not any perſonall indowment, nor the Princely perogative of place without this, that ever will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his glory, or his ſubjects good, neyther can he without this, procure his ſubjects continuance of obedience in love, nor cauſe his name to ſmell like a precious oin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>BVT as there is neceſſitie of counſell, ſo there muſt be choyce of counſellours. In the choyce of counſellours foure things muſt be obſerved,
<note n="1" place="margin">Number</note> there muſt be number equalitie, abilitie and honeſtie. For the firſt, it is a good rule of <hi>Comineus,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 1</note> that a King should haue many Councellours, and that he should never commit the helme of affaires, unto one mans hand: for as many eyes ſee more then one; ſo one man may put out his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters eyes, and become Maſter in effect.</hi> Among many inſtances take this one of <hi>Sejanus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coruel Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. Annal. lib.</hi> 5.</note> whom <hi>Tiberius</hi> advanced ſo highly with great offices, and the mariage of his daughter. He ruled all as he would; he was honored of all, and followed of all, more then the Emperour; to his image they offered ſacrifice, and they were in no ſmall eſteeme, to whom he gaue any reſpect. His brith day, with <hi>Ceſars,</hi> was celebrated. But <hi>like</hi> a monſtrous paracide, he went about to ſubvert his Maſter, who, (how vile ſoever he was) had deſerved well of him. But his great fall &amp; ignominious death, together with the death of his, did fully parallel the height of his rize. The like may be ſeene in <hi>Dancres</hi> rize and fall.</p>
               <p>As there muſt be a number,
<note n="2" place="margin">Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of power.</note> ſo there ſhould be an equalitie of power amongſt them: for to commit more to one then another, or, it may be then to all the reſt; that one wil goe neere to be Maſter, &amp; the reſt to be but bare <hi>voices</hi> to ſerve his deſire. One is no number, and where many ſit, and one ſwayeth all, there is a number in name, but none in effect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly for their abilitie;
<note n="3" place="margin">Abilitie</note> they muſt be men of judgment &amp; experience. The Romane Senate were pickt out as men of ſufficiencie for counſell; who for their wiſdom and gravitie
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8878:56"/>were called <hi>Senators,</hi> and for their care of the common good, <hi>Fathers;</hi> whoſe names were written in letters of gold, and ſo called <hi>Conſcripti.</hi> It is a queſtion amongſt Humaniſts and Stateſmen, Whether a weak Prince, and a wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel; or a weak Councel, and a wiſe King be better. Both reaſon and experience doe proue the former to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For many wiſe, can guide one vveak one better, then one wiſe many weak ones. Secondly, the wiſe King taketh no care of giving account; and therfore paſſeth them at his pleaſure: But the wiſe Councel, the weaker the King is, looketh the better to giue account of their actions. <hi>Severus</hi> had as many in Councel of War, as the Senate had: but what were they? Ancient ſouldiers experienced in Armes,
<note place="margin">Milites ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres, litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos etiam, &amp;c. ut Lamprid.</note> and in Militarie matters, ſuch as by their ſervice and carriage had deſerved well their places. Alſo ſchollers ſuch as were well verſed in Hiſtories, deſiring them to unfold what they knew from the Romane hiſtories, or any other, concerning any matter they had in hand. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Cyneas;</hi> hee had got more Cities by his eloquence, then by his own forces. I knew a very rawe boned youth of a meer Scholler, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an excellent and much honored Souldier.</p>
               <p>The Ancients doe <hi>Hyerogliph</hi> a wiſe and able Councel
<q>by a little fiſh, that goeth before the great Whale; which as an ancient Naturaliſt records, (how truely I will not now diſpute) doth ſeek and finde out every neceſſary for the Whales maintenance, diſcovereth all ſhallows and dangerous paſſages, demonſtrating the way by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſelfe. As long as this liveth the Whale is ſafe, this being dead, the Whale knoweth not what to doe.</q> Iuſt ſo, a learned and wiſe Councell provideth how the <hi>Throne of the Prince may be eſtabliſhed,</hi> looks out everie thing that may make him happy in his government, and his ſubjects happy in him: they foreſee likewiſe the ſhallows, and the ſhelfes of baſe indignity, vvhereupon a Prince may run himſelfe at unawares; by good counſels, motions and admonitions, they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8878:57"/>avert him from every thing that may diſhonour himſelfe, vex his ſubjects, or bring his Kingdom <hi>into contempt.</hi> In a word, a wiſe Councel, is the <hi>glory of his Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Theater of his actions;</hi> as <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Zeno;</hi> which being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by death, or diſlike, the pillars of State are removed, and ſo the edifice muſt fall. Princes then are not well adviſed, in making choice of inſufficient men for the government of State, that there own ſufficiency may appear the more. Wil the <hi>Sunne</hi> darken the Starrs, that it may ſhine the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Wil the <hi>fountain</hi> haue but dripping conduits, that all may come to the Conduits head? Or vvould a man be lame in his hands or feet, that the vvit of his head might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear? God indeed doth great things by vveak and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh means, yet that is his prerogatiue. Again, they are ſtrong and wiſe in him and through him.</p>

               <p>A third reaſon may be given from the divers effects that follows from good and evill counſellours. Forreignes uſe to inform themſelues of two things eſpecially in the State; <hi>Of the Councell of State, and of the Kings foole;</hi> if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell be wiſe and vertuous; and the foole ſimply plain and honeſt, there they gather evidences of a well governed State: But if the Councell be ſhallow, and corrupt; and the foole more knaue then foole, thence they collect the weakneſſe of the State. And indeed as the Councellors be good or bade, ſo falleth, or flouriſheth the State. A remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtance of this we haue in <hi>Ioaſh</hi> King of Iudah, who under the counſell of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> his uncle governed exceeding
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8878:58"/>well; hee was zealous of Gods ſervice; he razed out all the High places, purged the Church, rooted out <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, cauſed mony to be collected for the repairing of Gods houſe. In a word, <hi>He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, all the daies that Iehoiada lived,</hi> all which time he proſpered. But <hi>Iehoiada</hi> being dead, the Princes of Iuda, <hi>Baals</hi> old friends comes to the King with cap and knee (like diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling traitors as they were) <q>and tels him,<note place="margin">The Mar-Kings O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> no doubt, a fair tale, that liberty of conſcience would doe wel, and he might honour himſelfe and pleaſe his ſubjects much, to reſtore to them againe their old ſervice; hee had too too long been awed by an old <hi>hot-ſpur;</hi> who, it might be had ſhewed more fury then zeale in the harſh handling of his grandmother; and that, happily, for ſome end of his own; and howſoever he had ſaved his life, and brought him to the Kingdome; yet all this time he had been but <hi>his King,</hi> reſtreyned of thoſe pleaſures and delights, that otherwiſe he might haue had: For as for their parts, they had no delight to come at Court, where, for ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe fellow, they could not be merry: beſides, hee had quitted him of all his regall authority, in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip; wherefore it ſhould be greater for the honour of his Majeſtie, to take the power into his own hand, and to quit himſelfe of that yong fellow <hi>Zacharie,</hi> who would be as ſaucily peremptory as his father. As for the people it would be meat and drink to them, to haue their Groues and Gods in pomp; and his Majeſtie ſhould finde more obedience from them, and more loue amongſt themſelues, then ever he found under all <hi>Iehoiada</hi> his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; &amp; as for a few preciſe fellows that would grumble at it (that would be but for a time) an act of Parliament would fright them, and make them as mute as fiſhes. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their conformity with iſraels worſhip, and others, might gain their loue and good liking; yea, who knows but it might bring again the ten Tribes.</q>

But marke what was the end, even ſuch as the proceedings, <hi>The wrath of the Lord came upon him and his,</hi> and a ſmall company of the Aſſirians routed their great hoaſt; he ſpoyled the land in giving all to the enemies; The Lord ſmote his heart which cowardyſe, and his body with diſeaſes, his ſervants conſpiring againſt him, ſlew him, &amp; he wanted the honour of a kingly buryall.

So <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, rejecting the counſell of the three noble Dukes, as I ſhevved you, and follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vvill of the tvvo Earle Marſhalls, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brought not onely himſelfe to diſgrace and ruin, but alſo, by his fall, that fire of civill war was kindled, which was not quenched but by an ocean of Engliſh bloud. One inſtance more in <hi>Iames</hi> the third, King of Scottes; who being of an ingenuous diſpoſition, and a Prince of much
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8878:59"/>hope; yet, through cuſtome and euill counſell being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, became a very unhappy Prince, for caſting of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and addicting himſelfe to the beaſtly humors of a few baſe fellowes, as <hi>Preston, Cocheran, English Roger, &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew a Phiſitian,</hi> he ſpared not his owne bloud. So he runne from one evill to another, till in the midway, that overtook him,

               <p>One reaſon more, which might make Princes to be choyſe in their counſel, may be this. In my reading I haue obſerved great ones, miſcarryed by corrupt counſellours, to haue cryed out when it was too late. An example wee haue in <hi>Theodorick Marquies of Brandenburgh;</hi> who being of a haughtie ſpirit, not hearkening to the counſell of the wiſe, but to the counſell of the vitious and proud, he ran unto all kind of tiranny, and inſolency. At laſt, abuſing one <hi>Miſtovius</hi> a Vandalian king, provoked him by his rayling ſpeeches to forſake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie (for he was chriſtened and marryed to the Duke of Sax his ſiſter;) <hi>Theoderick</hi> raſhly adventured with his owne forces, to giue him fight: who being defeated, was baniſhed from his dominions for ever, hated of all, forſaken of his friends, and lived extremely poore in Madburgh upon the Almes of the Monkes. Being thus brought low, with many teares, he confeſt his outrages in particular, and that by them he had juſtly provoked the wrath of God againſt him.

<q>As the deſpiſing of his people, they wil term it a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inawing of them; the impoſing of what he pleaſeth upon them, an improuement of his prerogatiue Royall; the doing of all out of his own deviſe, the ſingularity of wit, or quinteſſence of policy.</q> Secondly, they vvill make them beleeue, they are affected and praiſed of others, and then it is as wel as can be, when indeed there is nothing leſſe.</p>
               <p>But to leaue their ſhifts, and the great Ones evils that accreweth upon them; my purpoſe is to point out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and the Phyſitian; namely, that <hi>plain-dealing Word,</hi> from the mouth of the <hi>man of God;</hi> againſt the venome of thoſe Aſpes, and the poyſon of all the ſinnes which they loue to palliate; I know no better Phyſitian then a good <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</hi> That ſaying of <hi>Gordianus</hi> is moſt true, and worthy the memory, <hi>That miſerably is that Prince from whom the truth is concealed.</hi> And <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11, complained that this one thing wanted in his Court.

               <p>One inſtance amongſt many is worth the noting.

One anſwered, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, another anſwered not ſo; for the <hi>Duke of Bulloin</hi> had carryed the richeſt Iewell out of the Tower, that ever was in it: yea, ſuch an one as was worth all the reſt, and <hi>the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducheſſes inventory</hi> beſides.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8878:75"/>let his people conſult with God, and let him be preſident over all their counſels, againſt whom there is no counſell: and let them looke likewiſe to the <hi>ſealing of their counſell, that their enemies might not reade it.</hi> Take heed of the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh Spyes that convey themſelues into your Courts, Camps and Chambers, in ſtrange habits, under the colour of <hi>travell, traffique, profeſsion of Sciences,</hi> or any ſuch like. Theſe be the <hi>Hyenaes</hi> that lye by the walles, with mens voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but wolues hearts, ready to diſcover every one that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out at dores. Theſe be like to that diſſembling Romiſh hypocrite, <hi>Aenobarbus,</hi> with a brazen face indeed, and a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den heart. Theſe are trayned up and taught the Art of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſo that all <hi>Cyphers</hi> and <hi>Hyerogliphs</hi> are familiar to them; but if they be caught, it is good to make them pay for their learning.</p>
               <p>But to come neerer home, into the inward ſociety of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: Kings and Generals in theſe daies eſpecially, had need, not with <hi>Oſiris</hi> King of Egipt to haue an eye onely in the <hi>top of the Scepter, or Sword;</hi> but they muſt haue their eyes in their own heads: yea, in their hearts, <hi>ad diſcernenda regia pericula opus est oculo animi. To diſcover the danger of great ones, they had need of the eye of the minde.</hi> As <hi>Achitophel</hi> is without giving counſell againſt <hi>David;</hi> ſo <hi>Doeg</hi> is ſtanding before the Lord when <hi>David</hi> asketh counſel of <hi>Achimelech,</hi> whereof <hi>Saul</hi> being by him informed, it coſts the Prieſts their liues. You ſee this <hi>hel-bound</hi> came to the place of Gods ſervice; as ſome it may be with us come to the Church to blow up the Church; and made likewiſe a ſhew of Gods ſervice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.7, an <hi>Edomite</hi> by Nation and Condition; yet an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by outward profeſſion. This ſhew without doubt made the Prieſts not miſtruſt him, but like a bloudie <hi>Edomite</hi> or <hi>Eſauite</hi> he ſeeks their bloud, and hath it. His heart was dyed in bloud; for there he conceiveth the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his tongue dipped in bloud; he maketh the matter worſe by relating; his hand bathed in bloud; with that he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8878:76"/>executeth the malice of his heart. Secrecie (if God had ſo ſo ordained,) might haue ſaved all this. Such be the kan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker wormes, and fretting moaths that cat out the heart of good counſell, ere ever it come to light. Such be the pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks of the Cabinat of counſell. Yea, ſuch and ſo many cloſe deceivers now there be of all ſorts,

For he that conſulteth with God, can both giue counſell, and keep counſell: He that keepeth with God, will keep with man: but becauſe theſe are very rare birds, as I haue ſhewed you, and one of theſe is as a Lilie amongſt thorns: For the tryall of meer civill men, let the practiſe of ſome great Warriours be inſteed of a rule.

Withall he ſhips himſelfe preſently in one of the beſt Saylors, and comming about before the ſign was given, he demandeth of every man his Commiſſion: thoſe that had opened their Commiſſion againſt the charge, he executed as Traytors; to the reſt who had obeyed, he gaue commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion indeed whether to direct their courſe.

It is not poſsible, as I ſhewed, to giue rules for all ſtratagems, becauſe of new occaſions; yet for taking in of places theſe be moſt uſuall.
<note place="margin">The Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of corrupting</note> Sometimes the Aſſaylant corrupteth ſome of the beſieged, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth the Town or Citie into the hand of the Aſſaylant, and ſo it is taken with little or nothing a doe: So <hi>Papyrius Curſor,</hi> the Conſul dealt with <hi>Milo,</hi> who kept <hi>Tarentum</hi> a Town of the <hi>Epyrots.</hi> Being taken with the great promiſes of the Generall, both of reward and ſafety to him and his; he perſwadeth the Town to ſend him as a Legate to <hi>Papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> of whom he received the reward promiſed, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Town, and by fair ſpeeches caſteth the people in a deep ſecurity, and ſo delivereth up the neglected Town into the hand of the enemy. So <hi>Marcellus</hi> uſed <hi>Soſiſtratus</hi> a <hi>Syracuſan,</hi> for betraying of the Citie: On a day when <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides</hi> did feaſt the people, he gaue intelligence to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who (while the ſecure inhabitants did revell it out in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe hilarities) ſcaleth the walls, killeth the watch, entreth the Town, which was a glorious victory, and a great booty
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8878:82"/>to the Romanes. So <hi>Hanibal</hi> took <hi>Tarentum</hi> by a corrupted Citizen, who was taught by <hi>Hanibal</hi> to aske leaue of the Captain to goe out in the night a hunting, which they durſt not doe by day. <hi>Hanibal</hi> had good ſtore of Boores killed ready for him, with which he often returned laden into the Citie, wherof he gaue a ſhare to the Captain: But one night <hi>Hanibal</hi> put his ſouldiers in the habit of Hunters, who being laden with prey, and let in at the gates, they killed the watch ſuſpecting nothing, ſet ope the gates and let <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> in, who killed all the Romanes ſaue them that fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle.

<note place="margin">Feying of remiſneſs.</note> or neglect of aſſaulting, or to doe ſome other thing then the main thing they intend. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> Generall of <hi>Athens</hi> beſieging the citie <hi>Agrigentina,</hi> which was almoſt impregnable: He deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the citie to ſend ſome of their counſell to him, with whom he might conſult of matters concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good.

Secondly, to attempt, continue, &amp; re-inforce aſſaults, where no good can be done, ſtandeth neither with the wit, nor credit of a Commander. It was well obſerved by <hi>Chilo, that things are not to be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that cannot poſsibly be done, and that being effected, the evill overgoeth the good.</hi> The great Turke, that cruell beaſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and re-inforced his aſſault upon the <hi>Rhodes</hi> ſo long, with the loſſe of ſo many, that the ſouldiers refuſed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, notwithſtanding of his threatnings, to renew the aſſault. It is a good ſaying, and experience proveth it true, <hi>that expence of danger, reclaimeth a man from fool-hardineſſe.</hi> This was verified in <hi>Spinola</hi> at the ſiege of Bergan-upzome, where he came ſhort of himſelfe in two things; firſt in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his opportunity; and ſecondly, when they were too good for him, he made ſuch deſperate and hote aſſaults, and was ſo prodigall of the bloud of his ſouldiers, that every one might know, it was none of his own: but the coſt of his raſh attempts made his courage to coole, till at laſt he left of a little wiſer then when he began.</p>
               <p>The laſt caution concerneth the perſon of the Generall,

               <p>But to proceed. It is a main point of diligence to make ſure at every point. That rule of <hi>Gregory</hi> is true in all kinds

               <p>A third point of diligence is to be uſed in ſallying out upon the enemie: ſo <hi>Furius</hi> the Roman conſul brake out by the gate called <hi>Decumana,</hi> and did the aſſailant great hurt: So <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> in the French-war telleth us, how he ſerved the enemie;

               <p>The third thing required is cunning:

As there be many examples of this kind, well knowen to men of reading and experience; ſo I will ſhew you but two or three examples for inſtance. In the beſieging of Rhodes, the enemie made an <hi>Ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie</hi> or walking-Tower, an engine then of great uſe, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like (it may be, though of greater quantitie) to the moving <hi>wooden ſconces</hi> uſed at the ſiege of <hi>Harlam.</hi> This over-topt all the Towers of the citie; to cut off the uſe hereof, the enginers
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8878:87"/>cauſed to digg through the walls, and in the night to make the way hollow, by the which they did convey it, which the enemie not perceiving (being covered with earth) as it came that way, it ſunke downe with the owne waight; ſo they loſt their engine and all their labour, and the citie was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. There were many prettie Stratagems uſed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Harlam,</hi> amongſt the reſt, this one put <hi>Duk de Alva</hi> from working any more that way. The defendant preceiving that the enemie meant to lodge in a new battered bulwarke, they left rampering againſt it, and fell to the mining of their owne bulwarke, wherein they put barrels of powder caſting many trenches round about it, the enimie offering to enter they quit the bulwarke; As a multitude of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie purſued and were come to Puſh of Pike, at the barrier of a trench they fired the mine, blew up, kild, and tooke to the number of 1600, and ſallying backe to their owne tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, recovered the ground of their bulwark, which againe they re-intrenched and kept. One more of excellent note, related by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in the ſiege of Apolonia. <hi>Trypho Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> did mine through the wall in ſundry places, till he brought his mines a flights ſhot without the gate, in all which he hung up veſſells of braſſe; ſo ſone as ever the enemie began to mine towards the citie, by the ſound of the veſſells they underſtood where he wrought; whereupon they countermined the enemie, by penetrating their owne, and powred veſſells of hot boyling water, urin, boyled ſand, and ſuch like upon the heads of their enemies,

And what hath betrayed many impregnable places into the hand of the enemy, but infidelity. The inſtances of later times, and of our own memory, are freſheſt and of fitteſt uſe. When <hi>Solyman</hi> the great Turke beſieged <hi>Buda, Thomas Madastus,</hi> a braue Captain, poſſeſſing the Caſtle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it valiantly; and, without doubt, had kept it, with great diſhonour and diſadvantage to the Turke, if his ſouldiers had not betrayed him into the hands of the enemy: For they took him (denying to render the Caſtle) and delivered both him and it to <hi>Solyman,</hi> upon condition, that with bag and baggage they might ſafely depart.

Not long after, the Scots rayſed their forces, under the conduct of <hi>Archbald Douglaſſe;</hi> they preſent themſelues before the Engliſh forces, which the King perceiving (though the time of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not yet expired) he ſendeth to the Captain, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

In the diſtracted ſoule of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy father of ſo hopefull ſonnes, loue, mercy, honour and fidelity, could not chooſe but make a great conflict. But to be ſhort, his rareſt wife, the mother of the children, proved here an helper aboue her ſex. Shee laid the honour of his houſe, the duty to his Country, and loyall fidelity to his Prince, in ballance againſt his private affection; ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that they might haue more children, but honour and fidelity once loſt, he could never recover; and ſhe had often heard from the learned, <hi>That to ſacrifice their children in the ſervice of their Country, was their highest prayſe.</hi> The Captain admiring the ſpirit of the woman, was perſwaded with her words, and removing himſelfe to another part, that he might not behold ſo dolefull a ſpectacle, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented rather to part with the ſonns of his loue, then with his <hi>fidelity in his ſervice.</hi>

Each na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath laboured to exceed other in the rigour of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Traytors. The <hi>Fgiptians</hi> prickt them through all their members to death.

               <p>The ſecond branch of this point,
<note place="margin">The keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a fit place.</note> concerneth the keeping of a fit place already taken. The wiſe enemy perceiving the odds of the place, will detract fight by all means and labour to ſhift his adverſary from his place, and then giue him battle. All the cunning in this kind that I haue read, affoord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a fitter inſtance then that of <hi>Hanibal</hi> againſt <hi>Fulvius,</hi> the Roman Generall; who being ſeated for fight very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8878:97"/>was more negligent in watching, and raſh in skirmiſhing then he ſhould haue been. <hi>Hanibal</hi> perceiving his humour in the very dark of the dawning, preſenteth a <hi>Perdiu</hi> to the Watch, who giving an alarum, <hi>Fulvius</hi> with his forces breaketh out, whereupon <hi>Hanibal,</hi> by the moſt of his forces laid in ambuſh, interceps the place, chargeth them on their backs, and ſlew 8000 of the braveſt ſouldiers that Rome affoorded. Not unlike to this, was that Stratagem of the Engliſh againſt the Scottiſh, at the Field of <hi>Floudon:</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> was counſelled by his Nobles, to ſeat himſelfe beyond the river of <hi>Til;</hi> where, by the opportunity of the bankes, and of the river <hi>unpaſſable</hi> (but at one bridge) they might ſaue themſelues, and haue the enemy at their mercy: for planting their Ordinance toward the bridge, they might let ſome of the Engliſh forces paſſe, as though they neglected the bridge, and therafter cut the bridge with the Ordinance, when they would, and ſo divide their enemies forces, which they might eaſily foile without danger to themſelues: but this counſell could not finde place with a <hi>man haſtening to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:</hi> yet counſell, or common ſenſe, ſo farre prevailed with him, as to fortifie himſelfe in the next fitteſt place namely, on a hill, at the foot of a great hill, called <hi>Zevist;</hi> the place was no where <hi>pervious,</hi> but by a ſtrayt and narrow paſſage, which they did fortifie on either ſide with their Munition; &amp; they ſtood no leſſe then need of this advantage, for they were far fewer in number then the Engliſh; who underſtanding by their Spyes, that there was no comming at them in that place, without eminent danger, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue their Camp, making ſhew as though they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Barwick, or otherwiſe into Scotland, to quit the dammage they had ſuſtained; which the King fearing eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, quits the place, ſets fire in the ſhiels, and ſuch things as they could not carry: the ſmoke deprived them of the ſight of the Engliſh, who fet a compaſſe about and croſſed Till, with all their Ordinance, comming on the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8878:97"/>backs of the Scots, whom they found in an equall plain called Floudon: Thus the Scots drawn out of their ſtrength, having their Ordinance to tranſplace, at the very incounter with two Battalions, either of them conſiſting of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as all their Forces, they were forced to fight at all diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; where in a hot and bloudy fight (as moſt hath been heard of,) they held it out till night overtook them. Great was the loſſe on both ſides, and for number equall: but the Scottiſh loſſe exceeded in quality of perſon; for they loſt as Royall a King, and illuſtrious Nobilty as any Europe could affoord: and all, as you ſee, upon neglect of good counſell, and want of taking heed.</p>
               <p>Neither would I haue any ſo to preſume of opportunity of place, as without valour and vigilancy it could ſecure them: for the enemy may adventure beyond all reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and ſo ſurpriſe them in the ſame wheron they doe preſume. <hi>Pharnaces</hi> charged <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſo hotly and unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the ſteep of a Hill; that had not their inexpugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble valour quit them, they had loſt both the place and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Thus being placed, they are to inure their raweſt ſouldiers under ſome good Leaders to light ſkirmiſhes; as the Romans inured their Gally-men firſt to uſe their oares by rowing on the ſands. Further, in keeping place for the annoyance of the enemy, men muſt take heed of falſe fears ſuggeſted by the enemy. So was <hi>Fabius</hi> hood-wincked by <hi>Hanibal.</hi>

               <p>NOW it followeth, that I come to a point of no ſmall importance; namely, <hi>the ordering of the battell,</hi> in the undertaking whereof it may be juſtly ſaid to me, as <hi>Pirrhus</hi> ſaid to one that would undertake to teach him the Art of imbattling; <hi>I ſtand not need</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of a Commander whoſe eares did never tingle at the ſound of a Trnmpet:</hi> Therfore let me apologie my weakneſſe once more, with the like ſpeech that the people ſhould uſe to <hi>Archippus; Take heed to thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The very word importeth the neceſſity of order; it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Acies</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſidor</hi>) <hi>from the defenſiue Armes of proofe,
<note place="margin">Quod fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro &amp; acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine glads orum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata ſit.</note> and from the ſharpneſſe of the ſword.</hi> When ſwords are ſharped, and the ſight of the eye is cleared, then they are fitted for cutting and ſight: ſo when men are ſet in battle array they are indeed called <hi>Acies:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A battel conſiſteth of men &amp; order, as of matter and form. <hi>Plutarch. in Marcello.</hi>
                  </note> and as man conſiſteth of <hi>matte</hi> and <hi>forme;</hi> ſo a battle conſiſteth of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>order. The weale and wiſely diſpoſing of a battle,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Vegetius</hi>) <hi>helpeth much to the victory. Gaius Flaminius</hi> being to fight againſt the French, was called off, both by the Senates letters, and by ſome prodigious tokens; he opened not the letters, but charged the enemy, where he ſlew 8000, and took 17000. This great victory of <hi>Flaminius</hi> was got,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2.</note> as <hi>Polybiu</hi> obſerveth by the due ordering of his Forces. This was the main help to <hi>Alexanders</hi> victories, as witneſſeth <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> in his fourth book. When the Romans had equalled the Carthaginians with a Captain; inſomuch that it was hard to tell, whether
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8878:98"/>was the better: where then lay the oddes? Not in number,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Non for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunae ut ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ii (qui foelices ſine ratione du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vocant) ſed ducum induſtriae &amp; acei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruendae periciae tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buitur vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria lib.</hi> 17.</note> nor in fayned fortune, nor in ſuch a Generall, as men call fooliſhly <hi>fortunate without reaſon:</hi> but it was eſpecially (as <hi>Polybius</hi> well obſerveth) to be attributed to the ordering of the battell: for the Roman <hi>Acies</hi> (as the Authour inſiſteth in commending of it) far excelled that <hi>Phalangical</hi> forme which <hi>Hanibal</hi> uſed, and that for ſundry reaſons. For in it there is an eaſier <hi>motion,</hi> a quicker <hi>turning,</hi> and fitter <hi>diſtance:</hi> This form will fit any place or time, where the <hi>Phalanx</hi> will fit but place and time appropriated.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Caeſar</hi> could not endure the leaſt errour in battle array; ſo <hi>Alexander</hi> by no meanes could be moved to break it. In his laſt battell with <hi>Darius,</hi> at Arbela, many Companies of the Perſians brake in, and droue away the Macedonians goods, <hi>Parmeno</hi> thinking much of that, deſired <hi>Alexander</hi> to fall upon them. At no hand, anſwered <hi>Alexander,</hi> will I diſſolv my battle, with which I muſt encounter the enemies forces, and not goe reſcue beaſts.

A notable inſtance of this we haue in <hi>Chabrias</hi> the Athenian Captain, who having embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled himſelfe in the ſide of a narrow Hil, in exceeding good order; <hi>Agiſelaus,</hi> that great ſouldier, chargeth him with 18000 foot, and 1500 horſe; where he was but 5000 foot, and 200 horſe; but in contempt, as it were, of him and all his forces, he cauſeth his ſouldiers to attend him, with their pikes ordered, and their Targets ſunck to their knees. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſelaus</hi> wondring at their excellent order,

               <p>Now for the ſeverall forms of battle array, it is neither pertinent, nor poſſible, for me to diſcover them. The <hi>Grecian Phalanx,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Acies,</hi> or the mixture of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8878:99"/>both is the moſt common; the frame of the firſt, you may gather from <hi>Vegetius;</hi> the deſcription of the ſecond, word for word you haue in <hi>Polybius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this point of imbatteling,
<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the battle to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to.</note> there is not onely a due form required, but alſo fit and convenient matter in the due place: ſome doe order the weakeſt forces in the front, and the ſtrongeſt in the wings; ſome doe the contrary: no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rule can be given in this, but as occaſion ſhall be given from the enemies order, ſo muſt they doe. The ordering of <hi>Xantippus</hi> his forces, was the onely means of reſtoring Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage from her ruines: He placed his ſtronger forces in the wings, and his weaker in the front. In the fight againſt <hi>Marcus Attilius Regulus,</hi> he charged the light forces, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſhot their ſhafts, they ſhould retire themſelues within the wings, drawing the enemies after them, and withall they ſhould get themſelues without their own, and help to compaſſe in the enemy.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>powers</hi> are often placed, as occaſion is giuen by the enemie; ſo ſometimes the enemie will deceive by a ſudden <hi>tranſpoſition of his order.
<note place="margin">Change of forces is of uſe.</note> Publius Cornelius Scipio,</hi> whoſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name was <hi>Africanus,</hi> warring againſt <hi>Aſdruball</hi> in Spaine, led out his Army ſome dayes before the fight, with the ſtrongeſt in the front, and weakeſt in the wings: but that day that he came to ioyne indeed, he led them in a contrary order,

I will conclude this point of ordering with theſe generall rules to be obſerved, in every forme of battle (though eſpecially in a four <hi>ſquare battell</hi> with a long front,) namely, firſt, that there be <hi>no gulfe,</hi> nor <hi>emptineſs</hi> (for ſo they terme it) in front or wing, or any particular part of a battel,

               <p>Another rule in battell ray, is this, that the Sunne, duſt, or wind be with them, and adverſe to their enemies. Where this advantage is got, it maketh much for the victory. This helped <hi>Hanibal,</hi> that ſuttle Commander, to the day, at <hi>Cannas,</hi>

<note place="margin">Pro aris &amp; focis pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur.</note> and to haue the other to fight with, aſſureth victory. Thirdly, from the preſervation of them and theirs; for goods, liberty, wiues and children; life, honour, and religion it ſelfe lyeth upon it. When the Romanes were to fight, they brought all the prey, the ſallary and richeſt ſubſtance that the ſouldiers had,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alex. ab Alex. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> and laid it bound in fardells hard by the colours, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be whetted on to fight. The Perſians bring their wiues and preciouſeſt things into the field; and ſo doth the Spanyard the richeſt things he hath.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they moue with hope of glory, and promiſe of reward. <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> are the bonds of Camp Diſcipline; but the ſouldiers muſt be carryed on to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, on the wings of <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is no ſmall motiue to obſerue the impoſſibility to eſcape the enemie (if they ſhould flye) through the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the place wherein they fight. <hi>Myronides</hi> the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Generall, leading his ſouldiers againſt the Thebans, brought them into a fair large field, where they were to fight; where he cauſed them all to lay down their Armes, &amp; view the place all round about. <hi>You ſee my ſouldiers</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>what a large field is heer, and our enemies are brauely mounted on ſwift horſes; therefore if we flee there is no poſsibility to eſcape; but if we ſtand to it, there is good hope of victory.</hi> Vpon which ſpeech they pur on reſolution to ſtand it out to a man, and did ſecond the ſame with ſuch courage,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Polyaen. l.</hi> 1.</note> that they carryed the day, and had a great victory, which they followed to <hi>Phocis</hi> and <hi>Locris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt motiue, and that of no ſmall force, is taken from
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:8878:102"/>the cruelty and inhumane condition of the enemy with whom they are to fight. If men fight againſt ſuch as are worſe then Beares and Lyons, that are never ſatisfyed with bloud; ſuch as the brood of Gog and Magog, Turkes and Papiſts, <hi>whoſe very mercies are cruelties;</hi> Were it not better to die upon the ſharp, with honour in the field, then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a while unto ſome cruell torment, intollerable ſorrow, and diſgracefull reproach? <hi>Fpaminondas,</hi> Generall of the Thebans, being to fight with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that he might not onely ſtrengthen his ſouldiers, but alſo ſharpen their indignation againſt their enimies, delivered in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was the determination of the Lacedemonians, if they overcame, to kill all the Males of the Thebans, man and mothers ſonne, and further to make ſlaues and captiues of their wiues and daughters, and laſt of all to equall Thebes with the ground. This did ſo inflame the Thebans againſt the Lacedemonians, that at the very firſt ſhock they overcame them.</p>
               <p>Doth not the belluin rage and cruelty,
<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> executed upon the Germanes and Bohemians, by woefull experience tell us, what mercileſſe and inhumane enemies we contend with; namely, the bratts of the bloudy whore. The ripping up of women, the ſhamefull abuſing of them, not to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the torturing of men with new deviſed torments; the bathing in the bloud of inoffenſiue children; the cruel mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Gods Miniſters, (who by the lawes of God and Nations, haue alwaies been ſacred.) In aword, their unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld immanity, aboue <hi>Turkes</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> would put life in a man to fight to the laſt gaſpe, rather then to liue and ſee, the leaſt part of theſe horrible indignities. To paſſe by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard outrage upon the Indian and Hollander (whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and valour, ariſeth out of the Spaniſh cruelty and perfidie) caſt but your eye upon the Spaniſh proviſion for 88, and you may ſee how like the baſe bramble <hi>Abimelech,</hi> they were determined to burn up the inhabitants; and as the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8878:102"/>ſcourges of Gods wrath, to whip us to death with tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſcorpions; as if they would haue made the torments of the Engliſh a terrour to all nations. But by you, my Lords and people of the Vnited Provinces, let this particular be obſerved in your encounter with the Spanyard. I know the monuments of the more then Saracen cruelties remains with you; you haue pictures in your houſes, and draughts drawn in the tables of your hearts: Yet let this ſharpen your reſolution to fight it out to the death; that if ever the black brood be maſters, you ſhall haue the blackeſt day that ever men had. If <hi>Radamanthus</hi> and <hi>Minos</hi> were come out of hell to torment, they could not exerciſe more cruelty then they would, upon you and yours; yea, as they would make you a ſpectacle to all the world, ſo they would ſend you, bodies and ſoules to hell, if they could. As <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> therefore was a ſworn enemy to the Romans in his childhood; ſo teach your youth, rather to die, then to liue at the mercy of the Spaniard: But, withall, fit your ſelues, and yours for death, better then you doe; and then let fire or water haue the land, and all that you haue: yea, if I may ſo ſay, and make it good in diſpute, let the devill haue it (as he had all <hi>Iobs</hi> ſubſtance) rather then the Spanyard haue it, who is a devill incarnate.</p>
               <p>As the bloudy diſpoſition of ſo deviliſh an enemy, ſhould put you on to fight it out to the very laſt pinch; ſo ſhould it likewiſe terrifie you from any terms of peace, which if once you intertain, you are caught in the trap. The Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard is like the Iriſh, who under a perfidious peace doth his adverſary more miſchiefe then in open war. Your charge and paines in peace ſhall be never a whit leſſer (for I am ſure you dare not truſt them) your damage and danger ſhall be greater. For who ever gained by peace with the Spanyard, England excepted, who hath of late gained repentance, I wiſh they be not too late in bringing forth the fruits of it. But to ſpeake of this, though I cannot ſpeak enough, I ſhall
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8878:103"/>be further occaſioned; onely I will ſhut it up for the preſent, with ſhewing what I thinke of that diſtreſſed people of Bohemia and the Palatinate, under the yoke of the enemy. If they had expected ſuch barbarous cruelties, they would all haue dyed upon the point of the pike, or edge of the ſword, rather then to haue truſted themſelues in the hands of ſuch men of <hi>blouds.</hi> But to conclude this point, all and every one of theſe meanes hath often prevailed; in ſo much that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals had need to be well verſed in this faculty, to which <hi>Vegetius</hi> doth not unworthily attribute very much; <hi>If exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſouldiers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe fear to fight, the exhortatiue power of the Generals oration, will rouze up their ſtrength, and kindle their courage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here ariſeth a doubt not unworthy the anſwering.
<note place="margin">A doubt.</note> What if the heart of the ſouldier be ſo ſunck,

The like of this did <hi>Charles Martil</hi> againſt <hi>Abdiramus</hi> the Saracen; knowing that the valour of his ſouldiers would countervaile the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the enemy, he preventeth all refuge for flight, by ſetting of the Camp on fire,

               <p>As for the Papiſts conjuring and conſultation, it is a main part of their Leiturgie. Yea, they haue one tricke more of this kind, namely, to giue Amulets to ſouldiers going to fight, whereby they aſſure them of ſecuritie from all hurt. A worthy Hiſtoriam giueth an inſtance of this. The French under the conduct of <hi>Charles Alobroge,</hi> going againſt <hi>Geneva;</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1502 had <hi>Amulets</hi> from their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fathers to hang about their necks, wherein were ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven croſſes with the beginning of <hi>S.

Ieſuits know it is foule play to wear amulets in fight, and againſt the lawes of Armes, and yet they will be doing. Let ſuch as loue ſoule or life, beware of theſe; for ſuch things haue neyther <hi>hid force, nor elementary qualitie</hi> to ſaue or preſerve. <hi>Austin</hi> of ſuch, hath a very good ſpeech, with a counſell ſubioyned; <hi>Many</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being driven to a ſtrayt, ſeeke helpe of the devill in the perſons of Charmers or Enchaunters, and in the ſuppoſed force of Amulets: what is this but to goe to our inviſible enemies, who kill the ſoule perſwading us that there is no helpe with God?</hi> The eares of ſuch

               <p>The ſecond thing to be avoided, is an <hi>ominous</hi> conſtruction of caſualties. When <hi>Scipio</hi> tranſported his ſouldiers out of Italie unto Africa, as he went a ſhore, his foot ſlip, and he

               </p>

You ſhould not want ſome of Gods <hi>Maiſters of requests, to lift up their prayers for you,</hi> but you muſt alſo in your own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cry mightily to God if you mean to be heard. There be too many (though your Graces are not) of the mind of that popiſh Earle of Weſtmoorland, who ſaid; <hi>He needed not to pray, he had Tenants enough to pray for him.</hi> Turn in (for Gods cauſe) upon the cloſets of your own
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8878:114"/>hearts;</q> examine your ſelues and be ſtill: And that it may not be a lame nor a liueleſſe prayer, get matter from reading, hearing, and meditating on the Word. Labour for holineſs, without the which it is impoſſible to ſee God. Get the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirit; for bare ſaying is not prayer: be fervent &amp; frequent: and for fitting you the better, afflict your ſouler in faſting and mourning, as your State is afflicted. With <hi>Heſter</hi> make your ſervants faſt and pray; Try but this courſe in truth; and as ſure as the Lord liveth, hee ſhall heap glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour upon your heads, and ſhame upon your enemies.</p>
               <p>This courſe will break the heads of the Dragons of your ſinns; this will offer violence to heaven, and as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force God to anſwer: this will be like an earthquake to your enemies, it will ſinke them, it will ſwallow them up. A pretty inſtance of this, I remember from the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an arch-enemy of the Goſpell, namely. <hi>Queen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Scotland;</hi> who fighting againſt God, and the erecting of his Kingdom, confeſſed openly, <hi>That ſhe feared more the faſting and prayer of the man of God</hi> Iohn Knox, <hi>and his Diſciples, then an Army of</hi> 20000 <hi>armed men.</hi> As your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect hath been great in this particular; ſo the blemiſh of out Nation, in neglecting and oppoſing this office, is indeleble. No Nation profeſſing the Goſpell, but they haue publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been humbled in ſome meaſure, we excepted: we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, haue not ſet forth to <hi>help thus againſt the mighty;</hi> which I thinke verily hath accurſed all the reſt of our helps, that they are as <hi>Water ſpilt upon the ground.</hi> It is true, that the ſoules of Gods people haue been exceedingly humbled in ſecret for the afflictions of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and haue poured out their hearts, in aboundance of ſighes and teares for their miſeries; But what is this to the publique diſcharge?</p>
               <p>Since I am fallen upon the point, I cannot but with griefe obſerue, that this Nation hath been at ſuch oppoſition and enemity with this duety, that it is thought as dangerous a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8878:114"/>thing to undertake it, as it was in Athens to make mention of the <hi>recovery of Salamis;</hi> or as it was amongſt the Iewes, to ſpeake <hi>in the name of Ieſus.</hi> What ſhould be the cauſe of this I haue often wondred; I am ſure of this, <hi>It is an evill ſign of an evill cauſe;</hi> yea, a fearfull fore-runner and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Gods <hi>long protracted wrath</hi> to fall upon us. Not any finne of omiſſion, or commiſſion, hath a more fearfull threatning againſt it, then this; Witneſſe the Prophet <hi>Eſay;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch.</hi> 22.12.13.14.</note> When God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>called to weeping and mourning, and to humiliation</hi> (in the higheſt degree, as the word importeth) <hi>then behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ioy and gladneſſe, ſlaying of Oxen,</hi> and all the contraries; by which they braved out God to his face. But what followed? A fearfull threatning; <hi>Surely, this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you till you dye (ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.)</hi> Whoſe eares ſhould not tingle to heare this? And whoſe heart ſhould not tremble to thinke upon it? And yet the beſt in this is too ſecure.</p>
               <p>But ſince the duety is ſo called for, and ſince it ſetteth ſuch an edge on invocation, it hath ſo prevailed againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Sion, and the neglect of it is ſo ſeverely threatned; what may be the cauſe, may ſome ſay, that in a Chriſtian Common wealth it ſhould be thus neglected and withſtood? If you will haue my opinion, in my judgement, I conceiue theſe to be the <hi>Remoraes,</hi> or break-necks of this duty. Firſt, the univerſall plenty (except the wants of the meaner for;) ſo long as there be Oxen and Sheep to kill, and ſweet wine enough; ſo long no humiliation:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioel</hi> 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>When the meat offering and the drink-offering fayleth them, then will the Priests</hi> (ſaith the Lord by <hi>Ioel) gird themſelues in ſackcloth, and lament and houle.</hi> A ſecond let is the conceited glory of the Church; <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> ſay they, and that imgreat pompe and glory, and what need we mourn? It is an <hi>outſide glury indeed,</hi> but there is but a little glory within. A third let is this; men are ſo inſlaved to ſin and Satan, and ſo vaſſalled to their own corruptions, that they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8878:115"/>dare not incounter with their Maiſters, for whoſe ſervice they haue <hi>bored their eares.</hi> The fourth <hi>Remora</hi> is this, the <hi>plants that are not of Gods planting,</hi> know well, that the uſe of humiliation, would find out the cauſes of our evill, amongſt which themſelues would be found to be the chief: So that it is no wonder, that they cannot endure to hear of humiliation. But if men be thus fearfull to awake ſleeping dogs, and will hazard themſelues, and the Nation upon the point of Gods Pike, what a fearfull plight ſhall they be in, in that gloomy day that is like to come upon us, wherein the Lord ſhall giue the Alarum. May not <hi>Ahab</hi> condemne us in this?

If we would humble our ſelus, the Lord would humble our enemies. It is his Covenant;
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Oh that my people had hearkened to me, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in my waies, I ſhould ſoon haue ſubdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their Adverſaries.</hi> Oh that wee were like Iſrael in the Iudges,
<note place="margin">

So if we would humble our ſelues and kill our ſinnes, our enemies ſhould quickly looſe what they haue got, and pay full deerly for all coſts and damages. But before I conclude the point take one caveat with the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8878:115"/>duty; that it be performed with ſincerity and ſingleneſſe of heart; for if it be done in hypocriſie, or perfunctorily ſlighted over in the performance, it provokes God, and plagues the performer. The Hollanders and French faſt, (but without exprobation be it ſpoken) they had need to ſend, as God ſpeaks, <hi>for mourning women,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 19.17.</note> that by their cunning they may be taught to mourn.</hi> A ſoft heart ſets well to a mournfull dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where this is wanting, there is no muſick. Humiliari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without reformation, is a mockery of God, and the undoing of a good cauſe. The Lord tels us in the 58 chapter of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the 7 of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> how he abhorred the faſting of his people without reformation, he giues a good reaſon in the fift and ſixth verſes; <hi>They faſted not to the Lord, but to themſelues;</hi> that is, for their own ends: as if men would ſerue their own turns with God, and care not a whit how hee be ſerved of them; it were juſt with God to mock both them and us with ſhews of favours, becauſe we mock him with ſhews of ſervice and amendment. And ſurely, if we look not to it, in the humbling of our ſelues indeed, all our hopes may be on a ſandy ground, and then that of the Lord by <hi>Ieremy</hi> be verified of us: <hi>Ah Lord God,
<note place="margin">

But God giue theſe words to work upon our hearts. I haue been the longer in this point, becauſe in it lyeth the ſtrength of all our forces: for <hi>pray well, and repent well,</hi> and you cannot chuſe but <hi>fight well.</hi> Prevaile once with God, and it muſt needs follow that you ſhall prevaile with men.</p>

               <p>I Come now to the very point at length which doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all, and that is the fight it ſelfe: Men muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray, but they muſt alſo fight againſt the enemy: they muſt not onely ſpeak, but they muſt alſo ſtrike: Strokes and words will doe well together. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> prayed againſt Amalecke, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> fought againſt them. <hi>Amalecke is a ſmiter, and he muſt be ſmitten.</hi> It is a generall fault amongſt us that profeſſe Chriſt, that wee can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a few prayers againſt Antichriſt; but a heart to abhor him, and a hand to ſmite him (even ſo far as our places reach) we haue not; wee are too too like that white livered Roman in <hi>Tully,</hi> who under excuſe to keep the Camp, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back from the battle, to whom <hi>Africanus</hi> ſaid well, hee could not endure <hi>officious ſeeming Souldiers,</hi>

The Ancients commend the Lacedemonians, that with <hi>their prayers, their hands were prompt to fight.</hi> To this effect was the ſpeech of that ancient Roman, that <hi>by bare wiſhes and woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh cryes, we must not look from God to overcome, but by counſell,

As for that Military cry uſed, and commended by many in the joyning bartell; yet holden as a baſe and barbarous thing of others, I will not much contend; onely this, as it is a thing moſt uſed by Turkes, Barbarians and Savages in their fight; <hi>ſo it rather ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſpirit, then ſhe weth ſpirit.</hi> The Barbarians haue this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation againſt this crying; <hi>that dogs that barke much, doe not bite much.</hi> True fortitude conſiſteth in a ſtout heart, and in an able hand. Of this mind was <hi>Regulus Mauritanus,</hi> and others. As for the Iſraelites uſing of it, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 6, it was the Lords command, and they had little oppoſition in the fight. As for <hi>Cato</hi> his commendation, and <hi>Caſars</hi> approbation of the uſe of the voyce in his Commentaries; I take them not to mean hollowing and hooping, but rather a couragious ſtirring up of one another, and daunting of the enemy with high words, and auſterity of looks. Howſoever, let the ſouldier remember, not to be daunted at the encounter of ſuch as come on with a cry.</p>

               <p>As this rule of warineſſe is given by <hi>Vegetius</hi> to a General, that he ſhould not onely haue a care of the whole Army, that he may bring them off, as he leadeth them on; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of himſelfe: ſo <hi>Iphicrates</hi> giveth a good reaſon, from a ſimilitude taken from the head, which is the fountaine of life and motion; if it be cut off, the body is but a trunck; ſo the <hi>loſſe of the Generall,

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8878:117"/>way to <hi>Mithridates</hi> forces, under the leading of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> drawing his ſword, he made toward the body of the battle; telling his ſouldiers, <hi>that if any aſked for their Leader, they ſhould ſay they left him fighting in Boeſia;</hi> at which, the ſouldiers being aſhamed, they went on to their ſervice.

               <p>Now as the Generall, from whom the life and motion of the ſervice, dependeth muſt be carefull of his ſouldiers, &amp; of himſelfe that he expoſe not them to any deſperate ſervice, nor himſelfe to danger beyond his place; ſo all the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers muſt be carefull to quit themſelves in their places: for the defence of their head; the maintenance of their good cauſe; the glory of their nation; the good of all that depend upon them; &amp; their owne honour and reputation. For mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie directions in fight, I think there be no better rules then that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though in another kind; namely, a ſpirituall fight. The termes are borrowed from a bodily fight, and therefore they are the fitter for the purpoſe. The words of the rule are very ſignificant and emphaticall, and therefore I ſet them downe; <hi>watch yee, ſtand faſt,

So it fell out with <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> who having in a manner overcome <hi>Valerius Laevinus,</hi> the Roman Commander, was by him in the ſame battle by the recollection of forces overcome. A nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance of this, Hiſtorians give in <hi>Q.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8878:125"/>the former of theſe two all men will eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in word (except they be Atheiſts) but the neglect of the latter ſheweth the former, in the moſt, to be but verbal: for if men would acknowledge that victory were from God indeed, they would never carry themſelues ſo inſolently in their victories againſt God as they doe. But to come to ſome proofs. Firſt, that all victories are of God. <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpeaking of the victories that <hi>David</hi> and his worthies obtayned:

To this purpoſe, the 22, of the ſecond of <hi>Sam:</hi> is worth your reading.</p>
               <p>The very heathens who were ignorant of the true God; yet did acknowledge their victories to be of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laboured to intice from their enemies their tutelar gods, to get them on their ſide, that they might the eaſier ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8878:125"/>them. Of that mind were the Philiſtims in that battle againſt the Iſraelites, when they perceived that the Ark of God was come into the Campe (though he were not there himſelfe) yet were they exceedingly afraid, and ſaid; <hi>God is come into the Camp, and they ſaid, woe unto us,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.6.7.</note> who ſhall deliver us out of the hand of thoſe mighty Gods?</hi> &amp;c. They ſpake not this out of any true fear, or yet out of any true knowledge that they had of God: but onely they feared that the Gods of Iſrael (for ſo they called the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances) would plague them, as the Aegiptians were plagued by them: but God in juſt wrath gaue his people into their hands: which victory they attributed to their god Dagon, and in token of their thankfulneſſe, they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed the beſt of their ſpoiles to him, namely, <hi>the Arke</hi> of God which they had taken from the Iſraelites. The Thracians, though a warlike people, yet the moſt barbarous of all Nations,

I ſpeak in particular to the Hollander, whoſe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances hath been admirable, and whoſe maintenance is from the very finger of God againſt the whole forces of Babel; but I fear their forgetfulneſſe wil make God weary of them: and we may well take them by the hand; for we haue not yet ſo much as reckoned with God for the debt of 88, and the Powder-plot deliverance. As we haue joyned in this ſo ſacrilegious a ſin of unthankefulneſſe; ſo God giue us to joyne both in reckoning and reſtitution.</p>
               <p>It is a thing incident to Gods children to be too too faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this very particular, if they looke not to it.

               </p>
               <p>To theſe two former, a third may be added reſpecting God, that if any place contended for,

               <p>The third reaſon may be taken from the office of the Magiſtrate, or ſupreme power, whoſe office as it is to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh true Religion, and to maintain it; ſo he muſt extirpate the falſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> beate the golden Calfe to powder; <hi>Ezechiah</hi> brake the brazen Serpent; <hi>Ioſiah</hi> and <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> plaid their parts in this; and where they left any relict it is (deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) laid upon them as a fault: <hi>but the high places they took not away.</hi> That point of ſeparatiſm againſt this is very unſound, whereby they would abridge the power of the Magiſtrate in reforming of religion.

But ſince it doth relliſh too much of Anabaptiſme, I would haue them let it goe. Hence likewiſe that groundleſſe reaſon, againſt the truth of the Churches of England, falls to the ground: that they are falſe, becauſe they had no call but inforced conſtraint by the ſword of the Magiſtrate: the Magiſtrate, as I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in abandoning falſe worſhip, and eſtabliſhing the true worſhip, doth nothing but what his place injoynes him: if

The Prelates, and pleaders for Conformity, haue no great reaſon to brag of theſe men, (as they were Biſhops not of Gods making,) for whilſt their heatts were deceived, and their eies vayled with the bewitching honours, and glorious ſhewes of Pabel, againſt the light of knowledge; they proved, as you ſee, enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt; therefore God puld them out of their rags, and caſt them in the Furnace, and then they proved his friends indeed; and ſo may ſome Prelates proue, if God bring them to the ſtake: But to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for all that they could doe, ſuch was the zeale of that holy Saint and happy King; <hi>that Lady Mary could haue no Maſſe at that time.</hi>

               <p>To conclude this reaſon, men would haue thought, that the union of Britains Kingdomes would haue cut ſhort the increaſe of Babel his Kingdom; and that the Foxes ſhould haue been forced, either to change their skins or holes: but we ſee, for our ſinns, by neglect of authority, that, to the diſhonour of God, the defacing of his Goſpell, the griefe of his people, and indangering of life, crown, and dignity,

               <p>Now I come to the laſt argument, which is, the evill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyng upon the toleration of any falſe religion. The Lord telleth the Iſraelits that if they deſtroy not all the idols of the <hi>Canaanits,</hi> that his <hi>angerſhould be kindled againſt them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.4.</note> and he would deſtroy them ſuddenly. How angry was God with <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> for hauing any thing to doe with idolatrous <hi>Achab:</hi> therefore he rebuketh him ſharply, &amp; threatneth him fearfully by the mouth of <hi>Hanani</hi> the <hi>Seer;

                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 37.</note> If the Lord were thus angry for joyning in civill affaires, how angry would he haue been if he had admitted their idolatry, or matched with them?</p>
               <p>The moſt part of the Kings and great ones,

                  </note> they eyther forget God altogether, or they thinke he is not the ſame
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8878:131"/>God. I would therefore haue them to caſt but their eyes upon examples of later times, and ſee how the Lord hath met with tolerators of falſe religion. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of France begun well, but he held not out; whoſe tolerating of others (though upon extremitie,) and imbracing of popery, for a kingdom, though from the teeth outward; <hi>cauſed the Lord</hi> (as one ſaid well to him) <hi>to ſmite first at his tongue, wherewith he had denyed him, and at laſt to ſmite at his heart, by one of the furies of the ſame helliſh religion, which for the world, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for a time to tollerate.</hi> How did <hi>Q. Mary</hi> pay <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> for pleading ſo hard to the King, that ſhe might haue a Maſſe. Men muſt not thinke, firſt to ſerve their owne turnes, and then to ſerve Gods turne; to goe on with policie (making religion dance atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance to it, which indeed ſhould ſerve religion) is to ſet the <hi>Aſse upon Chriſt, and not Chriſt upon the Aſse.</hi> The diſturbance, and diſtraction, of the Germanes, which weakeneth them exceedingly againſt the common enemie; ariſeth eſpecially from the toleration of diverſitie of religion. <hi>No thing</hi> (as one ſaith well) <hi>doth more combine the minds of men together, then unitie of religion: and nothing more diſ-ioyneth them, then diverſitie of religion.</hi> And it were good (me thinke) for the united Provinces, to make up their union with unitie of religion. And I may ſay boldly upon my former grounds, made good by inſtances, that they indanger themſelues moſt by toleration of diverſitie of religion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the multitude of idols in their houſes, whereof they make no bones, (though thereby they keep life in Poperie) what a confuſed chaos of hereſies, what a State renting breach of Schiſmaticall diviſions, with a hotch-potch of opinions are to be found with them: wherin to their ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes they are holden the <hi>Anteſignans,</hi> or ring-Leaders through the world; ſo that it is growne to a proverbe, <hi>If a man had loſt his religion, he might find it at Amſterdam.</hi> Which proverb. I think may rather be inverted thus: <hi>If a man bring any religion to Amſterdam, he had beſt take heed he looſe it not;</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:8878:131"/>for reaſon and experience makes this poſition good; that <hi>a place of oppoſition is not ſo dangerous to Religion, as that place where for Religion, every man may doe what he list.</hi> They muſt not think that their manner of government, or neceſſitie of trading, or any other thing, will ſerue to tolerate this toleration, againſt the Law of God and nature: the office of the Magiſtrate, the example of the enemy, and the evill enſuing on it, I wiſh they may obſerue and ponder; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the aim of their cruel enemy, (who looketh for more advantage out of this evill, then out of any other thing.) Where there be many Apes, there be but a few men: Many weeds, a little corn: So a ſmall deale of true religion, where is ſo much diverſity of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Where there is a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> or evill habite of humours, there is but a little good bloud; ſo an evill habit of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taketh away the life of true Religion, in which indeed conſiſteth the life of true policy. I pray God they may look to it; and that he would open our hearts from the head to the foot, to look to it at home, where Popery is as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed, as if it had publique toleration, and that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivency, which God will not winke at.</p>
               <p>And becauſe matching with Idolaters, ſetteth up the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt gate to idolatry; and by conſequence layeth us open to Gods heavy wrath, as God himſelfe doth witneſſe:

<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 28.9</note> For ſure it was a part of <hi>Davids</hi> admonition to <hi>Salomon,</hi> that in ſeeking the Lord he ſhould ſhun and abhor <hi>all Idolatrous Matches;</hi> for <hi>David</hi> hated all thoſe that held of ſuperſtitious vanity. And as <hi>Salomon</hi> forſook the Lord in this croſſing Gods command, and his fathers counſell, ſo he and all Iſrael ſmarted for it. I am ſure that this place well underſtood, and well applyed, is worth all the reſt that he hath ſaid: Yea, if his moderation be but laid in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, with principles of humane policie, it will be found lighter then vanity: And if he know no more of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards nature, practiſe and projects againſt us, then he hath delivered, he is but a <hi>Country Moderator</hi> indeed. I would but intreat him to take notice of the judgement, of as wiſe, as great, and as good a King as any lived in his age; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matching with the Spanyard. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12, of France, who for his goodneſſe was called <hi>pater patriae,</hi> being much importuned by <hi>Anne</hi> his Queen,

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:8878:132"/>know it is leſſe poſſible, for many reſpects, for the Engliſh and Spaniſh to agree, eſpecially as things goe now.

               <p>The ſecond branch of ſelfe-government, conſiſteth in the temperate uſe of ſuch effluence of things, as in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts many times they meete with all; as the beautie and bravery of their captive woemen, the delicacie of their fare; for this <hi>Scipio</hi> was much commended, and it was great <hi>Alexander</hi> his greateſt grace, that he would not ſo much as look upon his captives, the wife and daughter of <hi>Darius,</hi> but with good deliberation. But his laſt did not anſwer the firſt: for after that he had overcome all, he was overcome of cups, which marred all, and loſt him more glory then ever he got. Drunkeneſſe in a King is a capitall ſin. As the corruption of a fiſh beginneth at the head, and ſo goeth through the body; ſo the drunkeneſſe of a King maketh the land reele, and therefore woe to the land whoſe King is a drunkard. <hi>Philip</hi> after his victory, falling foule on cups, began in his drinke to inſult ouer his Greeke cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: but <hi>Demades,</hi> a captive, tooke him boldy up; thus, <hi>Art not thou King Philip aſhamed, whom the Grecians haue choſen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as another Agamemnon, to ſhew thy ſelfe like a bibbing Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites?</hi> at which freedome of ſpeech, <hi>Philip</hi> taking up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not his captive, caſt his Crowns and Garlands from his head, and his rich robes from his backe, and for very ſhame and ſence of diſgrace, done to himſelfe, by himſelfe, did ſet free <hi>Demades,</hi> and all the reſt of the Greeke captives. Behold in this a looking-glaſſe for great ones, how incident it is to them to err eſpecially in puffing-up victories; but it
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:8878:134"/>is more then Princely to correct themſelves at the checke of their vaſſals. Wee haue too many <hi>Philips</hi> forgetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and their places in their carriage of ſucceſſe, but too too few <hi>Philips</hi> humbling themſelues with ſhamefaſtneſſe, when by their inferiours they are rebuked. The delights and delicacies of proud and luxorious <hi>Capua,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hanibilem armis invic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vicit, &amp; enervavit Capua.</note> wherewith <hi>Hanibal</hi> was taken, when he had taken the towne, did him more hurt then all the Romane forces. To this effect there is a pretty ſaying of <hi>Hanibal; that he being invincible by Armes, was overcome with the pleaſure and plenty of the place. Aſia</hi> undid <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſlaine with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: for as Authors obſerve, he being capable of all things, and fortunate in every thing, grew ſo inſolent of his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that uſurping the prieſt-hood,
<note place="margin">Sueton.</note> he would needs be Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; he ſpoyled the treaſurie, and growing ſacrilegious: perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and luſtfull, he ruled all by luſt, and not by law.</p>
               <p>Now I proceed to the third maine thing; namely, their carriage toward the conquered. Firſt, they muſt ſhew huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, <hi>in humando corpora captivorum, in giving the ſlaine to be buried, or cauſing them to be buried.</hi> To that end, the Armies entered conditions, as Authors mention. <hi>Appion</hi> recordeth how <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Scipio</hi> did bury the bodyes of the <hi>Tribunes.</hi> It was an evidence of yeelding amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> if they demanded their bodies to be buried. It was counted (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> writeth in his Annalls) great crueltie in <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to forbid the buriall of the dead, with whom the cruel brood of Rome deſerveth to be ranked, and that in the firſt place; who not onely deny the buriall of the dead, but with all inhumane abuſes doe injurie the bodyes of the dead: they come nothing ſhort in this of the old typical <hi>Babel,</hi> hindering (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith) the buriall of the Saints bodyes,

                  <hi>giuing them to be meat to the fowles of the heauen, and their fleſh unto the beaſts of the earth,</hi> but the Lord will one day (as it is there) render them, <hi>ſeven-fold into their boſome.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:8878:135"/>Secondly, they muſt not envie their captives but as they are Gods enemies, and ſo they muſt hate them with a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred.</hi> It is reputed as a foule fault in the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (otherwiſe the braveſt ſouldiours in the world) that they hated captives with an irreconciliable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,

               <p>Thirdly, they muſt not, like vulturs, or <hi>Harpies,</hi> reioycingly glut themſelues in the ſight of bloud-ſhed, as the Dragon and the ſcarlet whore of Rome doth; ſhee muſt be <hi>drunke with bloud,</hi> ere ſhee bid hold, or ſay it is enough. Inſtances of this unquencheable bloud-thirſt in them, I could give you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many; take the carriage of <hi>Charles</hi> the 9, in the maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> for a ſcantling of the reſt: Beholding the bloudy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the butchered profeſſors, and feeding his eye upon a woefull ſpectacle, he breathed out this bloudy ſpeech: <hi>how good is the ſmell of the dead enemie;</hi>

                  <hi>that a ſlaine enemie ſmelled well, but a ſlaine ſubiect better.</hi> Tyrants muſt haue bloud though it be of their ſubiects. Yet for all this crueltie unbeſeening a man, much more a King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſubiects, that furie of France wanted not a popiſh helhound, to commend his crueltie in a ſet oration: but as he lived a man of <hi>blouds,</hi> ſo he made a bloudy end. Another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we haue in Queen mother, of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> (who was the contriver of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> maſſacre) ſhee confeſſed <hi>that ſhee delighted in nothing ſo much, as in the ſlaughter of Profeſsors of the Goſpell,</hi> although they were her owne ſubiects. To theſe wee may joyne our owne Queene <hi>Mary</hi> who could never be ſatiated with the bloud of her ſubjects, yea ſhee had preyed on the life of her owne ſiſter, if the Lord had not reſtreyned her: and which is mounſtrouſly unnaturall, ſhee meant if ſhee had lived, to haue taken up her fathers bones and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:8878:135"/>them. In this, popiſh Rome is worſe then heathen Rome, who had written in their <hi>Capitol</hi> for moderation of victory; <hi>parce victis, frange ſuperbos, ſpare the conquered, and bring under the proud. Epaminondus</hi> may be a patterne to all in this; who hauing reioyced for his victory at <hi>Luctris,</hi> came forth the next day amongſt his ſouldiers, all evill put on, and with a ſad countenance; the cauſe whereof being demanded by his friends; <hi>I did pleaſe my ſelfe too much</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>yeſterday, with conceit of the victory; but thinking on the bloud that is ſhed, I chaſtiſe my ſelfe to day. Agiſelaus,</hi> after his great victory at Corinth, ſeeing a great number of <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> lying ſlaine, was ſo far from reioycing or growing proud of the victory, that in ſorrow he cryed out; <hi>woe is me for Greece,
<note place="margin">Plutarch. in Lacon. Malo unu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> civem ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare, quam mille hoſtes occidere.</note> who in civill combuſtions hath loſt ſo many brave ſouldiers, as might haue conquered all the barbarians,</hi> (for ſo they termed other nations.) It was a frequent, and a worthy ſaying of <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> for the which <hi>Capitolinus</hi> commendeth him much, <hi>that he had rather ſave the life of one ſubiect then kill</hi> 1000 <hi>enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, they muſt not abuſe the conquered captive, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from him, and taking arrogantly to themſelues that which doth not become them. This did cruell <hi>Adonibezeck,</hi> who cut off the Thumbes of 70 Kings, and made them ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their meate under his table like Doggs. So <hi>Tigranes,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> cauſed four Kings to waite on his table. <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> had his chariot drawen with Kings; and <hi>Tamarlan</hi> carried <hi>Bajazet</hi> about with him in an iron cage. That diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable &amp; hatefull contempt, done upon the ſuppoſed body of <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth (found dead, as they ſaid, in the field of <hi>Floudon</hi>) was both voide of generoſitie &amp; humanitie: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he tooke Armes againſt <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, his uſage could not be bad enough. Yea <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Earle of Surry, Commander of the field, being puft up with the glory of the day, <hi>forgot his distance</hi> excedingly in the adding to his Armes; for where before he gaue the white Lyon, he gaue <hi>it then upon the red Lyon, tearing him as it were with his

                  </note> but ſtill they deſired to attend him at ſupper. The like, or greater generoſitie, was ſhowen by Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the mirror of man-hood, towards King <hi>Iohn</hi> his captive, before whom he ſtood uncovered, and would hardly be intreated to ſit down at ſupper.</p>
               <p>Fiftly and laſtly, they are to keepe quarters with captives being taken. For to caſt off priſoners, and put them to the ſword is againſt the lawes of Armes; though Turkes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts make no bones of this amongſt the reſt of their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet far be it from any ſo to doe, that profeſſeth Chriſt truely. And thus much for the conquerors carriage towards the conquered.</p>
               <p>Amongſt many motives that I might giue for this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, take onely this, that the conquerour ſometimes may come to ſtand in neede of the conquered, who as they will remember moderate uſage, and repay it with good; ſo they will requite tyranny with evill. Hiſtorians tell us how the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the great <hi>Masters of Armes</hi> through all the world, having ſo great an overthrouw at the battle of <hi>Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris,</hi> that they were forſaken of all their confederates, and had no refuge but to betake themſelues to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> againſt whom they had warred, and whoſe Walls they had rayſed; yet for all this they received them very lovingly.</p>
               <p>The fourth main thing followeth, how to demeane themſelues in the uſe of the goods or poſſeſſions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. It is true, that the ſpoyle is theirs, but the good creatures of God they muſt not ſpoile. The Lord giveth a ſtrait charge againſt this in <hi>Deut: when thou ſhalt lay ſiedge to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8878:136"/>a cittie and take it, thou ſhalt not destroy the trees thereof, and thou ſhalt not cut them down; onely that which is not for meate thou mayeſt cut downe.</hi> By this prohibition God reſtrayneth the waſte, and ſpoyl which ſouldiers uſually make in warre; and teacheth them thereby, that there is a kind of mercy to be manifeſted toward the creatures, ſpecially thoſe that ſerve for the maintenance of mans life. This reſpect had Chriſt to the creatures, when he cauſed his diſciples to take up the broken meate, after the people had eaten and were filled, <hi>that nothing ſhould be lost.</hi> It is reported of the <hi>Danes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Io.</hi> 6.12.</note> that with ſuch crueltie and outrage, they made havocke of all where they came, that they ſeemed not ſo much to conquer the land, as to conſume it; not ſo much to poſſeſſe it, as to race out the remembrance of it.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the laſt main thing required in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, namely his carriage towards his own. That Generall will never deale well with his enemies, nor get glory to himſelfe, that dealeth evill with his owne. As they haue bought the victory with their bloud, and the hazard of their lives;
<note place="margin">Saluſtais. Tacitus. Livius. Amain. Polyb.</note> their is no reaſon but they ſhould be both commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and rewarded. It was the cuſtome of the chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander (as all our ancient writers do record) after the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, to go up to ſome pulpit, and there with a ſolemne oration to commend the ſouldiers, according to every mans place, worth, and preſent ſervice; neither was that enough, barely to commend or giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thanks, but with their prayſe they diſtributed divers gifts. Is it equitie or conſcience that all ſhould fight, and one, or a few, carry a way the ſpoyle? <hi>David</hi> was of a more equall mind, who did not onely wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly divide the ſpoile of the <hi>Amalekits,</hi> to thoſe that were in the fight; but alſo gaue the 200 weake and wearyed ones a ſhare that ſtayed by the ſtuffe; and that was made a ſtatute and an ordinance for Iſraell, <hi>as his part is that goeth to the battle,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.24.</note> ſo ſhall his part be that tarryeth by the ſtuffe:</hi> neither was there any wrong done to <hi>thoſe wicked men</hi> who grudged at it: for,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:8878:137"/>firſt, they wanted not will, but power to goe to the battle: Secondly, they ſtayed by the ſtuffe to keep it, as neceſſary a peece of ſervice as to fight, and that with as great danger as thoſe that fought, if they had been overcome: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they had but a <hi>Geometricall</hi> ſhare, not an <hi>Arithmeticall,</hi> or equall with the other. The like inſtance you haue in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who according to Gods commandement, divided the ſpoile of the Madianites (on whom the Lord had avenged himſelfe) amongſt the ſouldiers and the people.

               <p>Amongſt many other reaſons for this enduring ordinance, <hi>David</hi> giveth a ſpeciall one, which I would haue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to obſerue; namely, that the ſpoyle is of the Lords giving:

                  <hi>You ſhall not doe ſo my brethren with that which the Lord giveth us.</hi> Obſerue here that <hi>David,</hi> the Generall, ſaith not, <hi>giveth me,</hi> but <hi>giveth us.</hi> Should one man, or a few, take that to themſelues, that God giveth to all? No ſurely, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> out of doubt, as many braue Generals had wont, kept little or nothing to himſelfe. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great reſerved onely hope; and our braue Generall <hi>Norice</hi> was like that Biſhop of Lincolne (a black Swan now,)

                  <hi>that never thought he had that thing, which he did not giue.</hi> The defrauding of ſouldiers of their ſhares of the ſpoyle, was ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt the Romans. <hi>Marcus Salinator,</hi> a man of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular dignity, was condemned by the people for unequall diviſion of the prey to the Souldiers.

That ſpeech
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8878:137"/>which I related of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, to his ſouldiers; the warre being ended, together with his bounty towards them; ſhewed him truely to be great.

But God for thoſe met with them, and ſet them in the right way ere he had done with them: for when after the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate, they got ſight of their ſin, and humbled themſelues for it; by faſting and praying they received a better anſwere, with aſſurance of the victory.</p>

Iudgement likewiſe hangs over the head of all halvers of the Lords day, making it neither

               </p>
               <p>For four things the people of God are to mourne, being defeated: for their ſin; becauſe they grieved God by it: for the want of Gods preſence: for making him depart from his inheritance: for the defacing of Gods glory, by the wicked in their ruffe. For the firſt: many will mourne; but rather for the puniſhment of ſin then for the ſin it ſelfe: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worm of conſcience begins to knaw, &amp; the terrours of hell preſent themſelues to them, then they cry and roare as though hell roard for them; but they are juſt like Mariners, when the ſtorme is ouer; or like fellous, they cry rather for the ſentence giuen againſt them, then for the felony committed. And ſome will cry for their ſin, but rather becauſe it is hurtfull and ſhamefull, then for grieving of God by it; as if a man by his lewdnes caſt into ſome loathſome diſeaſe, regrateth the ſin, for the diſeaſe it hath brought upon him; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby he hath offended God: but <hi>David</hi> cryeth out, on himſelfe and his ſin, eſpecially for the offence done to God by it; <hi>againſt thee, againſt thee, onely haue I ſinned,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.</note> and haue done that which is evill in thine eyes.</hi> As for the want of Gods preſence (ſo other things goe well with them) it is the thing that the moſt, leaſt regard: but for the godly, they make more of it then of all the things in the world; yea nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this will ſuffice the godly: giue them this (with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever) they can be content: the good things or hid treaſure of this life will ſerve the wicked well enough, without this, many ſay, <hi>who will ſhew us any good,</hi> (that is <hi>for the belly, backe,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8878:148"/>poſſeſsion, or height of ambition: but lift thou up over us the light of thy face (Iehovah:)</hi> for that is more joy to me then all the riches of the world wherein worldlings moſt delight. And herein is a main difference betweene the child of God, and the wicked; let <hi>Iſmael</hi> live and be great, and let <hi>Iſaack</hi> be the heire, with all the troubles that belong to the executorſhip; let <hi>Eſau</hi> haue pottage, and let the bleſſing goe where it will; let <hi>Saul</hi> be honored before the people, and let him be an off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt from the Lord: but let all this be put together, it is but traſh in the eyes of the godly in compariſon of his face. Obſerve their deſire in the burthen of the 80 Pſal: where, in their captivitie, ſtill they deſire; <hi>oh God returne us, and cauſe thy face to ſhine, and wee ſhall be ſaved:</hi> their deliverance, and all the happines that may follow it, will not be worth any thing to them, without the amiable looks of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. So that as <hi>Abſalon</hi> ſeemed rather to make choyce of death, then not to ſee the Kings face: ſo Gods people had rather die, or endure any ſorrow or calamitie under the countenance of a reconciled God, then liue <hi>Methuſalahs</hi> age, and inioy what the world could afford, under the frowning lookes of a diſpleaſed God. Yea, there is no temptation ſo ſharpe, no plight ſo dolorous, no fright ſo fearfull, nor agony ſo in expugnable, as the angry countenance of a forſaking God: for this maketh a man apprehend and conceive of God, as a God inarmed againſt him for his deſtruction. This the people of God conceive of their ſtate, as it appeareth by that patheticall expoſtulation in the aforeſaid Pſalme; <hi>how long wilt thou ſmoake, or ſhew the tokens of an angry countenance againſt the prayer of thy people? verſ.</hi> 6. What maketh the wound of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ſo unſupportable, but that the <hi>Chirurgion</hi> denyeth to looke at it, he letteth it ranckle and feſter, till who can beare it? yea, if the ſpirit of God ſhould not ſupport his owne by the finger of the ſpirit (though unſenſiblie) the beſt ſhould be at their wits end, and <hi>Sauls</hi> impatiencie ſhould drive them to deſperate courſes: But in this, he differenceth his owne
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:8878:148"/>from the damned, that as <hi>his one hand is over them, ſo his other hand is under them;</hi> he ſupporteth them wonderfully, when they conceive nothing leſſe, and by a ſecret inſtinct extorts prayer from them, even in the fearfull agony of their ſoules diſtreſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their prayers ſeeme to be rejected of him: but it is nothing ſo with the wicked, in their diſtreſſes from God his juſtly conceived wrath: for eyther they ſeek not at all for the appeaſing of Gods angry countenance, or with loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour they leaue preſently of, and run to the devill directly, or indirectly, for the alaying of the ſame. I touch theſe things but briefly, leaving the further enucleation to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat theologs, and ſound ſoule-phiſitians.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the glory of God, trampled under <hi>the foote of pride;</hi> wee ſhould be moſt moved of all, ſince wee provoke him by our ſinnes to forſake his owne inheritance, and to leaue his owne cauſe, to his owne diſhonour unmaintained. This lay heavy upon <hi>Eli,</hi> who when he heard of the looſing of the day, the ſlaughter of the people, and the death of his ſonnes, could ſit ſtill and beare it out; but when he heard of the taking of the Arke, he could ſit no longer.

It was the obſervation of an ancient Hollander in Leyden, upon the inſurrection of the Armenians; that hee feared God would being ſome great evill upon them, for the Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaies that did ſo abound; for he remembred that before that firebrand Duke de <hi>Alva</hi> was flung amongſt them, that this plague was begun amongſt them. The Lord giue them
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8878:151"/>and others to rid the land of them. The Lord threatneth to be gone, and hee will be gone indeed, both from Camp and Cittie, except we put away theſe evils from before his eyes.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this point: up and doe as you haue heard, and the Lord (no doubt) will be with you, and delight to doe you good in your deliverance.

               <p>The booke of God is ſo large in this, that I need not be any thing large in the proofe of it; take but that one place of <hi>Samuel</hi> mentioned, where after that Iſrael had humbled themſelues, and got their peace made with God; and <hi>Samuel</hi> to cry mightily to God for them; the Lord taketh the work of their hands, he incountreth with the enemy, by thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from heaven upon them,

It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that at the ſiege of Mountabone, the people of God uſing daily humiliation, as their ſervice would permit, did ſing a Pſalm after, and immediatly before their ſallying forth; with which practiſe the enemy comming acquainted, ever upon the ſinging of the Pſalme (after which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a ſally) they would ſo quake and tremble; <hi>crying, they

They are ſuch as <hi>Marcellus,</hi> of whom <hi>Hanibal</hi> ſaid; <hi>That hee was ſuch an enemy as was never quiet, whether he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, or were conquered:</hi> So whether they giue or take conditions, they are never to be truſted, as by their horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfidie and monſtrous cruelty, to all the world appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>

Amongſt many other inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this nature, I reade of ſome in the Scottiſh hiſtorie pertinent to the matter in hand. When the caſtle of Saint Andrewes was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the French, there were may of good faſhion put into the French Gallies; but the chiefe men of birth &amp; place as the two <hi>Liflyes,</hi> the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Grange,</hi> &amp; others, were committed to ſtrong holds in France, wherein were Captains; by whom they were much preſſed to heare maſſe: but they replyed, <hi>that though they had their bodies in keeping; yet they had no command over their conſciences, neither would they do any thing against their conſciences, if the King himſelfe would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them.</hi> Thoſe that were in the Gallies were no leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute: for being arrived at <hi>Nanſes,</hi> and the great <hi>Salve</hi> being ſung, a gaudie picture of the Lady was offered to them to kiſſe; amongſt the reſt a Scottiſhman being urged, he meekly deſired them not to trouble him, for he knew it was one of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:8878:154"/>the devils iewels, and a curſed idoll, and therefore ſaid he, I will not touch it. But the <hi>Patron,</hi> and the <hi>Arguiſier,</hi> with two officers, having the chiefe charge of all ſuch buſineſs, thruſt the idoll on his face, and put it betweene his hands, whereof when he ſaw he could not be rid, he tooke it verie orderly in his hands, and looking adviſedly upon it, he flung it into the river, and ſaid, <hi>let our lady now ſave her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſure ſhee is light enough, let her learne to ſwim.</hi> After which they urged no Scottiſhman with their idolls. Let men keepe themſelues from idolls, and God will keepe them, if it were in the middeſt of a firie furnace. I cite theſe the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe a great many of our <hi>Mirmaid-Profeſſors</hi> thinke outward preſence at Maſs very lawfull, though it be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; and for ſuch vaine toyes they eſteeme them as they are; if a man be compelled, who will hazard his life or libertie for ſuch a ſmall matter? but let me tell ſuch, that he that will ſave <hi>his life ſo, ſhall looſe it;</hi> and he that will looſe his life rather then diſhonour God in the leaſt thing ſhall ſaue it. The <hi>Iſraelits</hi> in their captivitie are ſtraitly enioyned to quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the cuſtomes of the nations; that is, not to defile themſelvs with any of their Idols, though they were to obey in all things lawfull.

There is more good under affliction, then wee are aware of: to judge it by the taſte, or to cenſure it by the outſide, will never bring patience: but conſider it in the effects, as it is, (namely, a bitter medicine, out of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hand of a good father, as it is ſanctified by the power of Chriſt, to all that are in Chriſt, both by power and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation:) and we ſhall not onely be patient in it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bleſſe God for it.

Things heere are ſubject to change; no day but it hath the own night; the cleereſt Sun-ſhine is often over-clouded on a ſudden; and the hotteſt ſeaſon hath lightning and thunder. As a Sea-faring man in the faireſt weather looketh for a ſtorm; ſo in the height of worldly happineſſe, let men looke for ſome diſaſter, that they may the better bear it when it commeth. <hi>Iobs</hi> affliction was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, yet the lighter by this, that <hi>the evill was come that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Our Saviour endeavouring to in-arm his Diſciples with this patience of proofe; fore-warneth them of the great perſecutions, and cloſe tryals that were to come upon them; namely, that not onely their profeſſed enemies ſhould caſt them in priſon, and bring them before Rulers, but they ſhould be betrayed even by their own parents, brethren and kinsfolkes, and they ſhould cauſe them to be put to death: But what remedy againſt all this?

Thou muſt willingly lay thy ſhoulder under the burthen, and thy neck under the yoke, <hi>and thy yoke ſhall be eaſie, and thy burthen light.</hi> This is that aſſueſcing, or inuring of a mans ſelfe to the bearing of the burthen, that the Prophet ſpeaketh of:

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.</note> there can be no true patience. <hi>Whatſoever things were written before time, were written for our learning, that wee through patience and comfort of the ſcripture might haue hope.</hi>

               <p>The laſt meane, is prayer by which wee doe intreat the God of patience to grant us patience. It is not natures gift; though men by nature will make a brave floriſh; it is the gift of God; <hi>to you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is not onely given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29</note> but to ſuffer.</hi> Affliction of it ſelf worketh not patience but rather impatiencie; yea, the word cannot worke it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the working of the ſpirit, and therefore <hi>if any be afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let him pray;</hi> namely, eyther for deliverance from the croſſe, or for patience under the croſſe: and let a man know this, <hi>that patience to beare the croſſe is a greater gift then deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the croſse.</hi>

               <p>The laſt thing of patience, is the true uſe of it, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the foure-fold obiect is foure-fold. Firſt in reſpect of God: we muſt not ſo much as in thought, murmur againſt him; but approve of all he doth. The ſecond in reſpect of the devill; if he by Gods permiſſion torture or tempt, wee muſt be patient till the Lord rebuke him. Thirdly, in reſpect of our
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:8878:159"/>ſelues, if the pricke of the fleſh buffet us wee muſt by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience beare it, if by prayer wee cannot remove it. Laſtly, in reſpect of others; if they be good wee muſt haue patience with their faylings; if bad be patient though they proſper, and beare if they perſecute. Two things eſpecially do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the uſe of patience; removall of ſin, and fixing of our eyes on Chriſt: both theſe, as uſefull to the third,

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:8878:161"/>the certainty or things hoped for, to be accompliſhed. Where firſt hee putteth a difference between hope in God, and hope in man, or humane things; the latter proveth no better then a broken reed, by which when a man is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he bluſheth at the folly of his confidence: but it is not ſo with that <hi>hope</hi> that is in God. It likewiſe meeteth with the worlds miſconſtruction of Gods cauſe in diſtreſſe, and the miſerable caſe of his people, when they ſee them deprived of their ſtate, their liues hunted like a Partridg, how they are forſaken of their friends, and made the object of the enemies wrath; then the world flouts them, Gods enemies whet their teeth on them, drunkards ſing ſongs of them, vile Varlets bring them upon the Stage, expoſing their names and perſons to all manner of contumelies, and open mockery. Is not this ſhame enough?

               <p>It is true, that in temporall deliverances, and vindicating his cauſe from the calumny of the enemy, he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by this or that particular man; yet it is enough to every particular man ſet a work, that hee will doe it by him or another: and why not by him as well as by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

               <p>If we look back upon the Romanes, men without hope; yet under ſuch hope as they had, did raiſe their ſtates from hopeleſſe ruines to the higheſt pitch of worldly glory. What ſtrayt was <hi>Maſsiniſſa,</hi> King of <hi>Numidia</hi> put to? Who for his own right, with ſore wounds upon him, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſwim a river, having no followers but foure, wherof two were drowned. He lived in a Caue, till his wounds were healed by hearbs; and ſetting to his work again, ſome forces being gathered to him, he was encountred again by <hi>Siphax;</hi> and by him overthrown, ſo that of 6000 there eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped but 70: but at length, by the help of the Romanes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> he was not onely reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his own Kingdom, but poſſeſſed alſo the Kingdom of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Varro</hi> his Colleague was of another heart, and ſhewed greater conſtancie of hope, in reſerving his life to further ſervice for his Country,
<note place="margin">Idem.</note> for which the Senate than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him much, that he did not deſpaire of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>I will conclude the point with one inſtance not unworthy our memory; namely, of <hi>Robert le Bruiſe</hi> King of Scots, whoſe ſtrayts were as many, and caſe as deſperate, and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as great, as any I reade of; his wife led captiue; his foure brothers, all worthy men, put to death; his whole friends and family partly ſlain, and partly ſpoyled of all they had; and made the ſubject of calamity; himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of great inheritance; yea, of a Crown and Kingdom, and forced ſometimes with one, and ſometime by himſelfe, to liue like a wilde man in the Mountains amongſt the beaſts; and whatſoever he attempted for a long time miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed; yet in all his miſery and penury he ſuſtayned himſelfe with hope, and as he did not doubt but one day he ſhould be King indeed: So in all his diſtreſſe, he did or ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unworthy of a King. He put not hand to himſelfe with <hi>Marcus, Brutus,</hi> or <hi>Cato,</hi> he cryed not with <hi>Caſar</hi> when his Companies, and deareſt and neereſt were loſt. His hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſſe in the end did anſwer his noble and hopefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: for he was not ſo low, but God exalted him as high. When once he roſe all went with him, victory and glory did ſtill attend him, he was happy in his Iſſue, in his friends, in his ſubjects, in the eſteem of all Nations, and moſt of all in his temperance, equity, and freedome from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. In the time of his proſperity, for his providence and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:8878:163"/>care, in peace; and valorous magnanimitie in warre, he might well be called <hi>the father of the country;</hi> yea I thinke verilie and am able to maintaine it, that if he be compared with the beſt Kings, that wee read of in hiſtories, he ſhall cary the laurell from them all. The illuſtrious <hi>Hamilton</hi> enioyeth to this day the honour, and inheritance conferred upon his anceſtor (being an Engliſhman) by that mirror of Princes; the glorie of whoſe Majeſtie he maintained, both by word &amp; ſword in the court of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2, where he killd one of the <hi>Spencers</hi> for his contumelious oppoſing of King <hi>Robert</hi> his due deſerved praiſe. As I deſire of God that Kings now living would pick a patterne out of him; ſo my ſoules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, out of my loue to that magnanimious Prince of the forefaid familie, that he would <hi>remember whence he is fallen, and return to doe his firſt works;</hi> yea, that he may never giue his ſoule reſt, till he waſh out with teares the ſtain of his unadviſed ſervice againſt <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all theſe will not ſerve to eſtabliſh; then take one for all from the booke of God: when good <hi>Mordecai</hi> was upon the verie pinnacle of <hi>Hamans</hi> contempt, juſt over the gulfe of imminent and inevitable death; his hope maintained him ſtill, and made him ſtay by it, at the Kings gate, in deſpite of <hi>Haman:</hi> the iſſue was anſwerable above expectation; for he was taken out of the loweſt pit, &amp; carried on the wings of the higheſt honor; but <hi>Haman</hi> his cruell enemie was throwen from the cloudie ſphere of his ſwelling pride, into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles pit of ſhame, and confuſion: ſo let all the enemies of God ſecret, or open, periſh, and let the horn of thoſe that love <hi>Sion</hi> be exalted.</p>
               <p>The fourth ground of your hope is from the enemie with whom you haue to deale; namely, <hi>the beaſt, the Dragon, and the falſe Prophet,</hi> whoſe ruine the Lord of hoaſts hath vowed and determined. It is a great advantage to know our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but a greater incouragment to know that our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are Gods enemies, and God their enemie; ſo that

               <p>There is a <hi>Spaniſhfied</hi> popiſh pamphleter, endeavouring to maligne the State of the Vnited Provinces (erected &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned by the finger of God) who diſſwadeth all men from the maintenance, protection, and partaking of, and with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and that by ſundrie calumnious <hi>idlements,</hi> rather then <hi>arguments.</hi> He draweth one from the fatall end of all ſuch as haue undertaken that buſineſſe, beginning with <hi>Monſieur de Lemmay,</hi> and ending with the late Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> of happy memory, aſperſing like a <hi>blacke mouthed Cur,</hi> as much he can, the life and death of <hi>a famous nurſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of vertue and religion; giving up alſo his virulent gorge upon that <hi>rightlie renoumed Prince of Orange.</hi> To which I anſwer; Firſt, that as unnaturall and violent death, doth not alwayes argue an evill life; ſo it doth not prejudice the goodnes of the action in hand, and therefore he is a greater <hi>calumniator</hi> then <hi>argumentator:</hi> againe if this without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther limitation be a good argument, then all men haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to forſake the maintenance of <hi>Babel,</hi> whereof he is a brat: for who haue led ſuch monſtrous lives, and made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ends, as the maintayners thereof? yea I ſhall be able to prove punctually, that never a man that hath put his hand to the maintenance of that <hi>Babiloniſh altar</hi> (carry it as cleanly as he could) but the Lord ſet <hi>Ieroboams</hi> marke upon him, in one kind or other: but that I refer to another treatiſe.

This is Princely indeed; <hi>for as we are all born</hi> (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith) <hi>to doe,</hi> ſo they eſpecially who are of high place and authority. To ſay much and doe nothing, doth not rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of the Engliſh wit nor worth; whoſe noble anceſtours for <hi>doing,</hi> haue been too plaguie fellowes, and enemies of State, terrible as an Army of Banners: It hath often been to me a matter of wonder how our Anceſtors, with ſo little or no light at all, diſpatched more work in a week, then we in a year; of which I conceiue (with ſubmiſſion of my iudgement) theſe to bee the reaſons. They preſumed of the work done; and made the honour of their houſe, and the glory of their name, the height of their ambition: but we in greater light, know that the <hi>work done</hi> wilnot ſerv; and as for the aſſurance of Gods loue (which ſhould put <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> in our <hi>hearts,</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> in our <hi>actions</hi>) but a few labour for it, and this is the <hi>death of action:</hi> and they with whom Gods honour is not in the higheſt eſteem, never make a true account of their own honour: Beſides this, our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had not ſuch helliſh pates, and hollow hearts to deale with, as our Senate hath. I wiſh they may work while they haue light, for when the night commeth they cannot work if they would; as I haue often ſhewed <hi>occaſion to be the ſoule of action,</hi> ſo when action looſeth breath, the ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and returns no more. They want no lawes for their warrant, nor patterns for their practiſe, nor wit to apply them: Let them up then and doe it, and God will be with them: Shall the fear of Forraigns freeze the waters of our
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:8878:167"/>counſell, and never a fire of zeale; nor even-down rain of courage, to thaw or diſſolue them? Shall the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane oppoſe piety, and maintain ungodlineſſe, and never a <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to take an order with them? Shall Snakes eate out the belly of the Common-wealth, and ſtill be kept aliue in our boſoms? Shall the eye of our high and honourable Senate be dimmed, or dazeled with a white Rochet? Shall, by him the Scepter of Chriſt be trampled under foot, to the caſting away of ſoules, and his ſoule not pay for it? Let me ſpeak freely, let them take heed how they let <hi>Benhadad,</hi> (that is, <hi>men committed to their keeping</hi>) <hi>goe,</hi> leſt the liues of them and us, goe for their liues, whom the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, either to deſtroy us, or to be deſtroyed. Shall a two faced <hi>Ianus,</hi> or a man with <hi>a heart and a heart,</hi> dance in a net, or goe masked, and no body ſee him, nor unmaske him. I hope they will pardon my freedom of ſpeech; for my boldneſſe is no more then my fidelity, loue and ſervice bindes me to. The fire of ſinne flames through all the land; and the fire of judgement is kindled in every corner, except ſome beſtir themſelues to quench it, we ſhall all be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The Lord giue reſolution and action, to thoſe that are in place, to ariſe for Sion; for be they ſure if they ſit ſtill, <hi>deliverance ſhall come to Zion another way,</hi> but they and theirs ſhal pay for it. As for the Hollander, I hope he will be ſtill in action; but I would haue him to do as much for God, as he doth for himſelfe; and as much againſt ſin, as he doth againſt the enemy, for that is the way to undoe the enemy: It were better for them to be caſt in the mould by a plaine and <hi>round dealing ministery,</hi> then to be battered by the Popes <hi>foure corned Canoniers;</hi> or the Arminians <hi>ſacred minions,</hi> the Prelates: Theſe be Hawkes of prey, wherewith the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Granvil,</hi> thought to haue ſeazed upon them in the beginning of their troubles; and they haue ever and anone been threatned with them ſince: Let them leaue off provoking God, leſt they be plagued with them,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:8878:167"/>as others of their neighbours be; and let them take heed of that <hi>Romiſh Dictatorſhip of conſtant Moderation;</hi> which is the next ſtep to Imperious Hierarchy.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:8878:168"/>I am here occaſioned to direct my ſpeech, once more, to the Lords of the Vnited Provinces; that as publique good is the end of their war maintained; ſo in raiſing means for the maintenance of warre, they would prefer the publick good to the private; which is not obſerved (as I think) in the ſtill increaſing of excize upon <hi>victuals;</hi> for this courſe injureth a many; as Commons, Tradeſmen, Travellers, yea, and the ſouldiers, whoſe bloud maintains the war, and the private profite redoundeth to a handfull; ſo great ones ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their purſes by this diſproportionable dealing, they who haue leaſt, and labour moſt, they haue often the moſt eaters, and payes moſt. Methinkes a Geometricall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were a great deale juſter, then an Arithmeticall; and that the ſtrongeſt horſe ſhould carry the heavieſt load. I ſpeake plainly, and out of loue to the State, which many waies may be hurt by this inequality. By-reſpect and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter intent, is like a ſtrange fire, which blows up the work, and brings vengeance on the Workman: it a cloſe kind of hypocriſie, and therefore the Lord will certainly plague it: inſtance that requitall of <hi>Iehu</hi> his pretended zeal in the deſtroying of the houſe of <hi>Ahab.</hi> Firſt, it was the Lords own work, and <hi>Iehu</hi> had his warrant for it in the 2 of the <hi>Kings; ch.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſmite the houſe of Ahab thy maſter, &amp;c.</hi> In the ſecond place obſerue his great ſhow of zeal, and oſtentation of uprightneſſe of heart in the execution of it: <hi>Come ſee</hi> (ſaith he, to <hi>Iehonadab</hi>) <hi>my zeale for the Lord:</hi> but ſelfe-reſpect marred all, for he wrought for himſelfe, and not for God; he looked more at the Kingdom, then Gods command; and therfore he who ſaw the thoughts, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe of his heart, requites him in his kind, <hi>Hee avenged the bloud of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They who now and then can affoord their hand and tongue, to lend Gods cauſe a lift for their own advantage, will diſcover themſelues when their own ends are ſerved; yea, God will uncaſe them, walk as cloſely as they can. As I often caſt mine
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8878:168"/>eyes upon the over-clowded eſtate or defaced beauty of the Scottiſh Church, I was occaſioned to call to mind, the prompt indeavour of the great Ones, to ruin <hi>Babel,</hi> and to rear up <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> It was a good work indeed, if it were well done; but as they made the Miniſters coat too ſhort, &amp; their own too ſide; ſo I fear, that the ſweetneſs that they found <hi>in Gods bread,</hi> (as one called it) and <hi>Babels ſpoyles,</hi> made them ſtand ſo ſtoutly to it; but theſe being raked out of their budgets by the <hi>long-necked-crains,</hi> that are come from the <hi>Egiptian-lake,</hi> the moſt of them, looks upon the cauſe now as though they had loſt their purſes. And laſt of all, to giue a touch upon our Engliſh Plantators in Virginia, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them eſpecially to examine the ends and the means; for all knows the iſſue is worſe and worſe, and like to proue ſtarke naughts: therfore both the end and the means ſtands need of rectifying.</p>
               <p>The Lord himſelfe giveth a good direction to this ſame effect, <hi>that ſuch as had planted vinyards and maried wiues,</hi> they ſhould not goe to War; the reaſon is given, becauſe the thougths and cares of theſe things ſhould not intangle them, and hinder them from fighting of the Lords battells in the field, by leaving their hearts at home;

Let them talk of peace what they will,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:8878:169"/>they haue no ſuch end, except they giue all the conditions, and then that peace is no better then ſlavery. Look but to the Spaniſh practiſe: <hi>Is he not like a Moule once in, never out, if he can chuſe?</hi> And <hi>if the fox be unkennelled, he leaveth ever an evill ſmell behind him,</hi> yea, and litters of cobs that peſters the Nation: or he is like the <hi>winding-Ivye,</hi> which ſheweth a naturall appetite to help it ſelfe by cleaving to other things, but it undoes all other things wherunto it cleaveth. <hi>Great Brittain had beſt look to her Vine.</hi> Private gain and by-reſpect was one of the three Romiſh plagues, I pray God rid our land of it.</p>
